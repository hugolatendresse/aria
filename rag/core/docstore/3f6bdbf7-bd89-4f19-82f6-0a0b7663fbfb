This trend in this context is sometimes referred to as a \u201cnet\u201d trend, though use of the \nword \u201cnet\u201d may be confusing as it is generally used to imply net of reinsurance.  Based on the historical \npattern in the adjusted loss ratios, the actuary selects a loss ratio trend to adjust the historical loss ratios to \nthe projected policy period.  One shortcoming of this approach is that trends in adjusted loss ratios over \ntime may not be stable, and it can be more difficult for the actuary to understand what may be driving the \nresults. \nSimilar to the discussion above about trending within the pure premium approach, it may be preferable to \nexamine the individual components of the loss ratio statistic.  In other words, the actuary examines \nchanges in each component (i.e., frequency, severity, and average premium) separately and adjusts each \ncomponent accordingly.  Assuming the historical exposures are used to calculate the frequency (or pure \npremium) and average premium used in the trend analysis, each component will be adjusted consistently.  \nLooking at patterns in historical frequency, severity, and exposure separately provides a better \nunderstanding of how each individual statistic is changing and therefore how the entire loss ratio statistic \nis changing.   \nInsurers may choose to use external indices, rather than internal trend data, to select loss trends.  For \nexample, a workers compensation insurer may use an external study as the basis to estimate the expected \nincrease in utilization and cost of medical procedures.  When this is done, the loss trend selection does not \nimplicitly account for any expected change in the insurer\u2019s premium or exposure due to an inflation-", "type": "Document"}}
