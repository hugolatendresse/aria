Actuaries refer to the most recent, less-\ndeveloped accident years as immature and the oldest, most-developed accident years as mature. \nAs a result, it is common to find the highest values of estimated IBNR for the most recent \naccident years, or the less mature years. As accident years mature and more claims are reported \nand settled, the estimate of total unpaid claims, which is comprised of case outstanding and \nestimated IBNR, will gradually approach zero.  \n \nAnother common phenomenon is that development factors tend to increase as the retention \nincreases. In 1987, E. Pinto and D.F. Gogol published a paper titled \u201cAn Analysis of Excess Loss \nDevelopment.\u201d46 Upon a review of excess claim development experience published by the RAA, \nthey observed: \n \nSince the data indicates that excess business generally exhibits much slower \nreporting than that normally associated with primary business, there appears to be \na relationship between the layer for which business is written and the resulting \ndevelopment pattern. It is this relationship that we intend to analyze in this paper \nfor both paid and reported losses. Applications to increased limits and excess of \nloss pricing are also noted. \n \nThe protracted development of excess losses reflected in the RAA study suggests \nthat the development is not only caused by late reported claims and increases in \nthe average reported loss per claim but also by changes at successive maturities \nin the proportion of claims with losses which are large multiples of the average. \nThus, the shape of the size of loss distribution changes at successive valuations. \n \nPinto and Gogol reviewed ISO excess of loss data as well as RAA data, and in both sets of data", "type": "Document"}}
