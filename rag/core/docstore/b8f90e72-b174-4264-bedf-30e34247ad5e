The non-base \nrelativities are adjusted upward to cover the amount of premium shortfall due to the cap and to offset the \neffect of the base rate change in the non-base levels.  This is explained in detail below. \nIn order to limit the total change for Level 2 to 20.0%, the base rate is decreased by applying a factor of \n0.9899 (= 1.2000 / 1.2122).  This results in a shortfall in Level 2 premium of $8,040 (= (21.22% - \n20.00%) x $659,000).  The premium collected from the non-base levels need to make up for that shortfall.  \nPrior to capping, the premiums from Levels 1 and 3 was $351,238 (=135,916 + 215,322).  The relativities \nfor these levels need to increase by 2.29% (=$8,040 / $351,238).  Furthermore, the relativities for Level 1 \nand Level 3 need to be adjusted to negate the effect of the base rate offset.  This means the final \nadjustment factor for these levels\u2019 relativities is 1.0333 (=1.0229 / 0.9899).   \nTable 14.13 summarizes these calculations.  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)\nLevel Premium Current Selected\nDifferential \nChange\nOff-balance \nFactor\nSelected  \nOverall \nChange Total Change\nPremium on \nProposed \nRates\n11 3 8 , 0 0 0$             0.8000       0.6500       -18.75% 1.0541 15.00% -1.51% 135,916 $          \n26 5 9 , 0 0 0$             1.0000       1.0000       0.00% 1.0541 15.00% 21.22% 798,840 $          \n32 0 3 , 0 0 0$             1.2000       1.0500       -12.50% 1.0541 15.00% 6.07% 215,322 $          \nTotal 1,000,000$          -5.13% 1.0541 15.00% 15.01% 1,150,078 $       \n(5)= (4) / (3) - 1.0\n(Tot5)= (5) weighted by (2)\n(6)= 1.0 / (1.0 + (Tot5))\n(8)= [1.0 + (5)] x (6) x  [1.0 + (7)] - 1.0\n(9)= (2) x (1.0 + (8))\n14.12  Rate Change Before Cap p ing Base Lev el Imp act", "type": "Document"}}
