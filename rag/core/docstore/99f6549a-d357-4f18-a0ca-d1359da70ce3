Reported losses for the calendar year are equal to paid losses plus the change in case \nreserves during that twelve-month calendar year.  At the end of the calendar year, all reported losses are \nfixed. \nThe advantage of calendar year aggregation is that data is available quickly once the calendar year ends.  \nThis information is typically collected for other financial reporting so it represents no additional expense \nto aggregate the data this way for ratemaking purposes.  The main disadvantage of calendar year \naggregation is the mismatch in timing between premium and losses.  Premium earned during the calendar \nyear come from policies in force during the year (written either in the previous calendar year or the \ncurrent calendar year).  Losses, however, may include payments and reserve changes on claims from \npolicies issued years ago.  Calendar year aggregation for ratemaking analysis may be most appropriate for \nlines of business or individual coverages in which losses are reported and settled relatively quickly, such \nas homeowners. \nAccident year aggregation of premium and exposures follow the same precept as calendar year premium \nand exposures\u2014and in fact, the method is often referred to as calendar-accident year or fiscal-accident \nyear.  Accident year aggregation of losses considers losses for accidents that have occurred during a \ntwelve-month period, regardless of when the policy was issued or the claim was reported.  Accident year \npaid losses include loss payments only for those claims that occurred during the year.  Similarly, reported \nlosses for accident year consist of loss payments made plus case reserves only for those claims that \noccurred during the year.  At the end of the accident year, reported losses can and often do change as \nadditional claims are reported, claims are paid, or reserves are changed. \nAccident year aggregation represents a better match of premium and losses than calendar year", "type": "Document"}}
