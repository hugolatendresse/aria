Accident year grouping is easy to achieve and easy to understand. It \nrepresents claims occurring over a shorter time frame than for the policy year or underwriting \nyear aggregation, implying that ultimate accident year claims should become reliably estimable \nsooner than those for a policy or underwriting year. There are numerous industry benchmarks \navailable to actuaries based on accident year experience. Finally, tracking claims by accident year \nis valuable when there is change due to economic or regulatory forces (such as inflation or law \namendments) or major claim events (such as atypical weather or a major catastrophe) which can \ninfluence claims experience.  \n \n \nDisadvantages of Accident Year Aggregation \n \nThe most significant disadvantage of accident year aggregation is the potential mismatch between \nclaims and exposures for insurers. It also includes claims from policies underwritten and priced at \nmore varied times than policy or underwriting year aggregation. For self-insureds with high \ndeductibles, accident year data can mask changes in retention levels and/or changes in insurers \nthat could have an effect on claim development patterns. \n \n \nAggregation by Policy Year or Underwriting Year  \n \nClaims can also be grouped according to policy year. For policy year data, the actuary sorts \nclaims according to the year in which the policy was written. Policy year aggregation directly \nmatches the premiums and claims arising from a given block of policies.19 The grouping of \nclaims by policy year for insurers is similar to the grouping of claims by underwriting year \nfrequently used by reinsurers.
