Since the Cape Cod method uses \nclaim development patterns to calculate the used-up premium, which is a critical component in \nthe expected claim ratio determination, this method may not be appropriate for this example. \n(Similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, we limit the reported cumulative claim \ndevelopment factors to a minimum of 1.00 for the Cape Cod technique.) \n \nWe have detailed rate change information for XYZ Insurer as well as information regarding the \neffect of legal reform on the insurance product. We incorporate this information into the Cape \nCod projection method presented in Exhibit II. The first adjustment is to restate earned premium \nfor each accident year as if it were at the 2008 rate level. These calculations are contained within \nColumns (2) through (4) of Exhibit II, Sheet 1. In Columns (6) through (9), we adjust the current \nreported claims for the influences of inflation (through claims trend factors) and tort reform. Once \nwe have on-level earned premium and adjusted claims, we proceed to calculate estimated claim \nratios as described in the previous example for U.S. Industry Auto. We divide the adjusted claims \nby used-up, on-level premium to derive the claim ratios shown in Column (13). We use the label \n\u201cEstimated Adjusted Claim Ratios\u201d to indicate that the reported claims are adjusted for inflation \nand tort reform. We rely on the claim ratio for all years combined, 70.8%, from Column (13) \n(also shown in Column (14) for each year) as our starting point for developing estimated \nunadjusted claim ratios in Column (15). These claim ratios, which are adjusted back to the rate \nlevel, inflationary level, and tort environment for each accident year, become our starting point \nfor projecting expected claims in Exhibit II, Sheet 2.  \n \nWe follow the same format as the example for U.S. Industry Auto in Exhibit II, Sheets 2 and 3.", "type": "Document"}}
