We first derive the incremental paid claim triangle \nfrom the cumulative paid claim triangle (Exhibit V, Sheet 6). We then divide the incremental paid \nclaim triangle by the incremental closed claim count triangle to produce incremental paid \nseverities. It is worthwhile to pause and observe the patterns in this incremental triangle of paid \nseverities. There are significant differences in the incremental paid severities at each maturity \nage. In general, the paid severities increase as the claims mature. This is consistent with the \ncommon belief that smaller claims settle at a quicker rate than more complicated and costly \nclaims. Such patterns are particularly common for long-tail lines of insurance such as U.S. \ngeneral liability. \n \nSince the paid severities for each accident year are at different cost levels, we adjust the severities \nto a common time period (i.e., common cost level) before we analyze the severities and make \nselections. For decades, actuaries have used exponential regression analyses to determine annual \ntrend rates. One reason for the use of exponential regression analysis is because it implies a \nconstant percentage increase in inflation. Many actuaries believe such trends tend to be most \nindicative of the normal inflation process. Actuaries also use weighted exponential least squares \nfit in order to give greater weight to more recent experience. Linear projections are rarely used \ndue to the implied decreasing percentage trend. \n \nIn Exhibit V, Sheet 7, we summarize the results of numerous regression analyses for the \nincremental paid severities. To determine a severity trend, we fit many exponential curves to the \nincremental paid severities at each maturity age. We run a variety of combinations of years and", "type": "Document"}}
