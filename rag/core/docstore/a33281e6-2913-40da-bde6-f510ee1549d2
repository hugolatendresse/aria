(Note that \nScenarios 1 through 4 are labeled Examples 3 through 6 in the summary table in the Introduction \nto Part 3 \u2013 Basic Techniques for Estimating Unpaid Claims.) \n \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nIn real-life situations, actuaries know neither the \u201cactual\u201d claim development patterns nor the \n\u201cactual\u201d ultimate claim ratios prior to final settlement and closure for any particular accident year. \nHowever, for the purpose of demonstrating the effect of a changing environment, we design a \nmodel in which we can calculate the \u201cactual\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d IBNR requirement. In developing this \nexample, we use a ten-year experience period, accident years 1999 through 2008. We assume that \nthe earned premium for the first year (i.e., 1999) is $1 million. We then assume a 5% annual \npremium trend to develop earned premium values for each subsequent year in the experience \nperiod. \n \nIn Exhibit III, Sheet 1, we summarize the key assumptions and calculate the actual IBNR for each \nscenario. The actual IBNR is equal to the ultimate claims projection, which is based on the given \nultimate claim ratio for each accident year, minus the reported claims as of December 31, 2008. \n \nThe following table summarizes the assumed reporting and payment patterns for the steady-state \nenvironment. \n \nTable 5 \u2013 Key Assumptions \nSteady-State Environment \nReporting and Payment Patterns \n \nAs of Month \n% \nReported \n% \nPaid \n12 77% 42% \n24 90% 71% \n36 95% 84% \n48 98% 92% \n60 99% 96% \n72 99% 98% \n84 100% 99% \n96 100% 99% \n108 100% 100% \n120 100% 100% \n \n99", "type": "Document"}}
