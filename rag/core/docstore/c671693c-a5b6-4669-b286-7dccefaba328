Though these \ntechniques might not necessarily be used directly for producing rate differentials, they are often used to \nenhance the underlying classification analysis in various ways as described below. \nFactor\tAnalysis\t\nFactor analysis, of which principle components analysis may be the most commonly used, is a technique \nto reduce the number of parameter estimates in a classification analysis (such as a GLM).  This can imply \na reduction in the number of variables or a reduction in the levels within a variable.   \nAn example may best illustrate how factor analysis works.  If one can summarize the exposure correlation \nbetween two variables in a scatter plot, a regression line can then be fit that summarizes the linear \nrelationship between the two variables.  A variable can then be defined that approximates this regression", "type": "Document"}}
