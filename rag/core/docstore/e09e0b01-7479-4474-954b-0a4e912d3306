The pink line with the square markers on the graph represents the results of a \nunivariate analysis.  The disparity suggests vehicle symbol is strongly correlated with another variable in \nthe model (perhaps age of driver, prior accident experience, or some other variable), and the univariate \nresults are distorted as discussed earlier. \nIn a multivariate analysis, it is important to understand the phrase \u201call other variables being considered.\u201d35  \nThe GLM results of one variable are only meaningful if the results for all other variables are considered at \nthe same time.  So for example, the indicated relativity for vehicle symbol 10 discussed above will not be \nvalid if the model is manipulated to remove or change other key predictor variables in the model.  \nConsequently, the results of one variable are only valid if the results for all other key variables are also \nbeing used.  In other words, that indicated relativity for vehicle symbol 10 is dependent on the other \nrelativities being considered.  Chapter 13 discusses how the company\u2019s final rate relativities often deviate \nfrom the actuary\u2019s indicated relativities for business reasons, but for now it is important to understand the \nstatistical relevance of the comments above. \nA\tSAMPLE\tOF\tGLM\tDIAGNOSTICS\t\nChapter 9 listed statistical significance as an important criterion for evaluating the appropriateness of \nrating variables.  A previous section of this chapter listed the statistical diagnostics to be a major benefit \nof GLMs.  These are tools that aid the modeler in understanding the certainty of the results and the \nappropriateness of the model.  Certain diagnostics can help determine if a predictive variable has a \nsystematic effect on insurance losses (and should therefore be retained in the model).  Models should be \nrefined until only such significant variables remain.  Other diagnostics assess the modeler\u2019s assumptions", "type": "Document"}}
