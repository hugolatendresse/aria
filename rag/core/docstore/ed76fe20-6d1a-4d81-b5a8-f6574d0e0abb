Upon \nsuch convergence, it is common practice to normalize the base class relativities to 1.00.  For example, \nassume the relativities derived above represent the final iteration.  Normalizing the base class relativities \nto 1.00 would result in: \ng1 = 3.39 / 1.72 = 1.97 \ng2 = 1.72 / 1.72 = 1.00 \n \nt1 = 1.81 / 1.08 = 1.68 \nt2 = 1.08 / 1.08 = 1.00. \nRecall from above that the univariate relativity for t1 was 1.86 (this was used to seed the initial value of t1 \nin the minimum bias equations).  After one iteration of the minimum bias method, the replacement value \nfor t1 is 1.68.  The minimum bias result reflects the fact that the cell for urban males has considerably \nmore exposure than the other cells; consequently, the experience in that cell is given more weight. \nFinally, the base loss cost also needs to be adjusted to reflect the normalization: \nBase loss cost = $100 x 1.72 x 1.08 = $185.76. \nNow the reader should better understand the phrase iteratively standardized one-ways.  The method \noutlined above involves performing several iterations of univariate analysis on rating variables, each time \nadjusting for the exposure weight and the indication of the previous variable in the sequence.  Note that \nthe simple example outlined above only considers one of the minimum bias methods (multiplicative \nstructure with balance principle) using the pure premium statistic.  In addition, it considers only two \nrating variables each with two levels.  The computation required to incorporate several rating variables", "type": "Document"}}
