Is ALAE increasing \nbecause the size of the portfolio is increasing (i.e., are there more insureds for recent years than \nprior years)? Were there operational or policy changes over the experience period that have led to \nearlier recognition of ALAE case outstanding? The same magnitude of change is not evident \nwhen looking down the columns of the age-to-age factors for paid ALAE. \n \nTo reflect the most recent experience, we select age-to-age factors based on the volume-weighted \naverage for the latest three years for both reported ALAE and paid ALAE. We select a tail factor \nof 1.00 for reported ALAE since there is no further development beyond 96 months evident in the \ntriangle. For paid ALAE, we select a tail factor of 1.005 based on a review of the ratios of \nreported ALAE-to-paid ALAE from 96 months to 132 months and consideration of the observed \npaid development during this period. In Exhibit I, Sheet 3, we project ultimate ALAE using the \ndevelopment technique described previously in this book. The format of Exhibit I, Sheet 3 is \nidentical to the development projection exhibits of many other chapters. The reported and paid \nALAE projections are very similar; we do see a significant increase in the ultimate ALAE for \naccident years 2006 through 2008. \n \nOur second approach for the projection of ultimate ALAE is in Exhibit I, Sheets 4 through 8. This \napproach uses the development technique applied to the ratio of paid ALAE-to-paid claims only. \nWhen using a ratio approach for ALAE, the first step is to determine an estimate of the ultimate \nclaims. In Exhibit I, Sheets 4 and 5, we project ultimate claims for Auto Property Damage Insurer \nbased on reported claims only and paid claims only, respectively. While there is some evidence of \nan increasing volume of claims, it does not appear as significant as the increase in ALAE", "type": "Document"}}
