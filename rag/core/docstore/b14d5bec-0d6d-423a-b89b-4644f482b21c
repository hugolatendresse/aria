The trends used for these projections can be estimated via internal insurance \ncompany data (e.g., workers compensation payroll data) or via industry or government indices (e.g., \naverage wage index).   \nPremium\tTrend\t\nIn addition to inflationary pressure, the average premium level can change over time due to changes in the \ncharacteristics of the policies written.  These changes are referred to as distributional changes, and the \nresulting change in average premium level is commonly referred to as premium trend. \nThe following are a few representative examples of circumstances that can cause changes in the average \npremium level: \n\uf0b7 A rating characteristic can cause average premium to change.  For example, homeowners \npremium varies based on the amount of insurance purchased.  This variable is generally indexed \nsuch that it increases automatically with inflation; therefore, average premium increases as well.  \n\uf0b7 A company may decide to move all existing insureds to a higher deductible.  Raising the \ndeductible decreases the amount of coverage and, therefore, the premium charged.  Assuming the \ncompany moves each insured to the higher deductible upon renewal and that the renewals are \nspread throughout the year, there will be a decrease in average premium over the entire transition \nperiod.  The trend will not be expected to continue once the transition is complete.   \n\uf0b7 One company may purchase the entire portfolio of another company.  If the new risks are \nsomewhat different than the existing book of business, that can lead to a very abrupt one-time \nchange in the average premium.  For example, if a typical homeowners insurer acquires a book of \nbusiness that includes predominantly high-valued homes, the acquisition will cause a very abrupt \nincrease in the average premium due to the increase in average home values.
