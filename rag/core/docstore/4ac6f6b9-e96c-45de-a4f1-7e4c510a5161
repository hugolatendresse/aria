UW  Expenses UW  LAE  Losses  Premium \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d   \nThe role of a pricing actuary is to estimate each of these components for the period during which the \nproposed rates will be in effect.  The preceding chapters provided techniques for estimating the projected \npremium and the projected losses and LAE.  This chapter addresses: \n\uf0b7 How to derive projected underwriting expense ratios \n\uf0b7 How to incorporate the cost of reinsurance in a ratemaking analysis \n\uf0b7 How to incorporate an underwriting profit provision in rates \nSIMPLE\tEXAMPLE\t\nThe following simple example illustrates how expenses and profit are incorporated within the \nfundamental insurance equation and in the ratemaking process.  Assume the following: \n\uf0b7 The average expected loss and LAE ( L  EL \uf02b ) for each policy is $180. \n\uf0b7 Each time the company writes a policy, the company incurs $20 in expenses ( FE ) for costs \nassociated with printing and data entry, etc. \n\uf0b7 15% of each dollar of premium collected covers expenses that vary with the amount of premium, \n(V), such as premium taxes. \n\uf0b7 Company management has determined that the target profit provision ( TQ ) should be 5% of \npremium. \nIf the rates are appropriate, the premium collected will be equivalent to the sum of the expected losses, \nLAE, underwriting (UW) expenses (both fixed and variable), and the target underwriting profit.  Using \nthe notation outlined in the Foreword (p. vi), this can be written as: \nProfit.
