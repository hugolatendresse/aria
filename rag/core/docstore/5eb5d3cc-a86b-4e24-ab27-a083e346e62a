Two methods for calculating the overall adequacy of current rates are \ndiscussed in detail in Chapter 8. \nIn addition to achieving the desired equilibrium at the aggregate level, it is important to consider the \nequation at the individual risk or segment level.  Principle 3 of the CAS \u201cStatement of Principles \nRegarding Property and Casualty Insurance Ratemaking\u201d states \u201cA rate provides for the costs associated \nwith an individual risk transfer\u201d (CAS Committee on Ratemaking Principles, p. 6).  A policy that presents \nsignificantly higher risk of loss should have a higher premium than a policy that represents a significantly \nlower risk of loss.  For example, in workers compensation insurance an employee working in a high-risk \nenvironment (e.g., a steel worker on high-rise buildings) is expected to have a higher propensity for \ninsurance losses than one in a low-risk environment (e.g., a clerical office employee).  Typically, \ninsurance companies recognize this difference in risk and vary premium accordingly.  Failure to \nrecognize differences in risk will lead to rates that are not equitable.  Chapters 9 through 11 discuss how \ninsurance companies vary rates to recognize differences between insureds.  \nBASIC\tINSURANCE\tRATIOS\t\nInsurers and other interested parties (such as insurance regulators, rating agencies, and investors) rely on a \nset of basic ratios to monitor and evaluate the appropriateness of an insurance company\u2019s rates.  This \nsection provides a brief introduction to these ratios, which are further discussed in later chapters.    \nFrequency\t\t\nFrequency is a measure of the rate at which claims occur and is normally calculated as: \n. Exposures ofNumber \nClaims ofNumber  Frequency \uf03d  \nFor example, if the number of claims is 100,000 and the number of earned exposures is 2,000,000, then \nthe frequency is 5% (= 100,000 / 2,000,000).  Normally, the numerator is the number of reported claims", "type": "Document"}}
