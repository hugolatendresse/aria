Accurate  \n2. Unbiased  \n3. Statistically independent from the base statistic \n4. Available \n5. Easy to compute \n6. Logical relationship to base statistic. \nRates should have as low an error variance as possible around the future expected losses being estimated.  \nA complement of credibility that helps achieve this is considered accurate. \nThe complement should not be routinely higher or lower than the observed experience.  Said another way, \nthe differences between the complement and the observed experience should average to zero over time.  If \nthis is not the case, the complement is biased and the actuary needs to determine whether or not the bias is \nmaterial. \nThe distinction between accurate and unbiased is important.  An unbiased statistic varies randomly \naround the following year\u2019s losses over many successive years, but it may not be close.  An accurate \nstatistic may be consistently higher or lower than the following year\u2019s losses, but it is always close.   \nThe complement should also be statistically independent from the base statistic.  If it is not independent, \nthen any error in the base statistic can be compounded.   \nThe data required to compute the complement should be readily available.  If it is not, then the \ncomplement of credibility is not practical.  The calculations should also be relatively easy to perform and \nunderstand.  This is particularly important when the actuary must provide justification to a third party \n(e.g., regulator) for approval.   \nFinally, the complement should have an explainable relationship to the observed experience.  If there is a \nlogical relationship, it is much easier to support the use of the complement to any third party reviewing \nthe actuarial justification. \nMETHODS\tFOR\tDEVELOPING\tCOMPLEMENTS\tOF\tCREDIBILITY", "type": "Document"}}
