During \n2006, the insurer settled Claim ID 2 for $200, which was less than the $300 case outstanding. \nThus, on this claim there was a saving from the initial case outstanding estimate. \n \nThe final settlement for Claim ID 3, however, was higher than the initial estimate. When the \ninsured reported the claim near the end of 2005, the claims adjuster established an initial case \noutstanding of $400. During 2006, the insurer made a payment of $200 and reduced the case \noutstanding to $200. Thus, the reported claim estimate for this particular claim did not change \nduring 2006; the payment of $200 offsets a similar reduction of $200 in the case outstanding. \nDuring 2007, there was a final settlement for Claim ID 3 of $300. The final incurred value for this \nclaim was $500, or $100 more than the reported claim estimates at year-ends 2005 and 2006. \n \n59", "type": "Document"}}
