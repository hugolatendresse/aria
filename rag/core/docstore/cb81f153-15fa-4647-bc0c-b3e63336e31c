By comparison, the generalized method \nintroduces a third claim measure that allows distinguishing the cost of maintenance from the cost \nof closing. This is an important distinction for lines of business where a claim can remain open \nfor an extended period of time with regular claim activity, such as workers compensation. The \ngeneralized approach also allows for flexibility in selecting the weights appropriate to the insurer \nand to the particular segment of business. \n \n \nKey Assumptions of Generalized Approach \n \nKey assumptions of the generalized approach include:  \n \n\uf0b7 Expenditure of ULAE resources is proportional to the dollars of claims being handled. (This \nis in contrast to Johnson\u2019s assumption that ULAE costs are independent of claim size and \nnature.) \n \n\uf0b7 ULAE amounts spent opening claims are proportional to the ultimate cost of claims being \nreported. \n \n\uf0b7 ULAE amounts spent maintaining claims are proportional to payments made. \n \n\uf0b7 ULAE amounts spent closing claims are proportional to the ultimate cost of claims being \nclosed. \n \nConger and Nolibos state that the appropriateness and sensitivity of these assumptions warrant \nfurther analysis, both as a matter of general research, and for a particular application of either \nmethod. For their particular application, the dollar proportionality was an assumption that \nproduced reasonable indications of unpaid ULAE. \n \n \nMechanics of Generalized Approach \n \nIn the generalized approach, Conger and Nolibos define U1 + U2 + U3 = 100%, where: \n \n\uf0b7 U1 \u2013 percentage of ultimate ULAE spent opening claims \n\uf0b7 U2 \u2013 percentage of ultimate ULAE spent maintaining claims \n\uf0b7 U3 \u2013 percentage of ultimate ULAE spent closing claims \n \nIn conducting an analysis of unpaid claims and expenses, the actuary would determine reasonable", "type": "Document"}}
