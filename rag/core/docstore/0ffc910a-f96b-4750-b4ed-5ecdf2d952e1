The model is then used \nto estimate the expected annual catastrophe loss based on the insurer\u2019s exposure.  The catastrophe loss \nprovision produced by the model is simply added to the non-catastrophe loss amount to determine the \naggregate expected losses to be used for pricing. \nIn most years, the actual catastrophe losses will be less than the expected annual provision, but in years \nwith a major event or events, the actual losses will be significantly higher than the expected annual \nprovision.   \nCompanies typically monitor the number of policies in catastrophe-prone areas and may use non-pricing \nactions to control the concentration to minimize the financial impact any one event can have on the \nprofitability of the company.  For example, the company may restrict the writing of any new business, \nmay require higher deductibles for catastrophe-related losses, or may purchase reinsurance.  In addition to \nthese non-pricing actions, the actuary may alter the underwriting profit provision in the rates to reflect the \nhigher cost of capital needed to support the extraordinary risk caused by the higher concentration of \npolicies.   \nMore detailed discussion of catastrophe models and the effect on rates is beyond the scope of this text. \nReinsurance\t\nReinsurance is insurance purchased by primary insurance companies to transfer some of the financial risk \nthey face.  Historically, actuaries performed ratemaking analysis for primary insurance on a direct basis \n(i.e., without consideration of reinsurance).  As reinsurance programs have become more extensive and \nreinsurance costs have increased substantially for some lines of business, some ratemaking analyses are \nnow performed on a net basis (i.e., with consideration of reinsurance).  \nReinsurance can be split between proportional and non-proportional covers.
