Policy year experience can be very important when \nunderwriting or pricing changes occur, such as a shift from full coverage to large deductible \npolicies, a new emphasis on certain classes of business, or an increase/decrease in the price \ncharged leading to a change in expected claim ratios and possibly a change in the type of \npolicyholder insured. Policy year aggregation is particularly useful for self-insureds where only \none policy may apply. \n \n \nDisadvantages of Policy Year Aggregation \n \nThe primary disadvantage of policy year (or underwriting year) aggregation is the extended time \nframe. As seen in our previous example, a policy year can extend over a 24-month time period, \ngenerally resulting in a longer time until all the claims are reported and a longer time until the \nultimate claims can be reliably estimated. Policy year data can also make it difficult to understand \nand isolate the effect of a single large event, such as a major catastrophe or a major court ruling, \nwhich changes how the insurance contracts are interpreted. \n \n \nAggregation by Report Year \n \nFor some lines of insurance, such as medical malpractice, products liability, errors and omission, \nand directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, coverage may be dependent on the date on which the claim \nis reported to the insurer (i.e., claims-made coverage). For these lines of business, actuaries often \nprefer to use report year data for developing estimates of unpaid claims. Report year refers to \ngrouping claims according to the date of report to the insurer. For example, report year 2008 \nconsists of all claims with report dates in 2008. Actuaries use this grouping to estimate the", "type": "Document"}}
