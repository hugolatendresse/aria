If the two \ncompanies being compared charge exactly the same premium, then all policies will be in the range \ncontaining 0% (i.e., -5% to 5%).  On the other hand, if the competitor has a very different premium \nstructure, the bars will be dispersed across the different ranges.  In the example, the overall average \ncompetitive position is -7% (i.e., on average, the competitor\u2019s premium is 7% lower than the company\u2019s \npremium), but the competitiveness ranges from a low of -60% to a high of over 100%.  This variation in \nthe competitive index highlights significant differences in the rating algorithms and rate relativities \nbetween the two companies.  Similar charts can be produced for the other metrics.  \n                                                      \n46 This is also referred to as a market basket of risks. \n13.7  Policy Count by Percentage Competitive\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\nPolicy Count\nCompetitor/Company - 1.0", "type": "Document"}}
