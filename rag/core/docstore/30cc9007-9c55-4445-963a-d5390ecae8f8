How does the insurer treat \nreopened claims? Are they coded as a new claim or is a previously closed claim re-opened? If the \ninsurer treats reopened claims in the latter, there could potentially be a decrease across a row in \nthe closed claim count development triangle. Does the insurer include claims closed with no \npayment (CNP) in the reported and closed claim count triangles? How are claims classified that \nhave only expense payments and no claim payment? \n \nXYZ Insurer indicated that the closed claim count development data excludes CNP claim counts. \nThe reported claim count development data is based on the sum of closed claim counts (excluding \nCNP) and claims with case outstanding values; thus, the reported claim count development \ntriangle also excludes CNP counts.  \n \nOur review of these triangles leads to the following observations and questions: \n \n\uf0be At 12 months, we see that the reported claim counts experienced an increase of 40% [(1,932 / \n1,373) \u2013 1.00] and closed claim counts had an increase of 30% [(235 / 181) \u2013 1.00] between \naccident years 2003 and 2004. Over this same time period, we observe a 76% increase in \nreported claims. Similarly, the increases in claim counts at 24 months for accident year 2005 \n[(2,293 / 2,168) \u2013 1.00 = 5.8%] are not as significant as the increases in reported claims \n[($47,432 / $40,180) \u2013 1.00 = 18.0%].
