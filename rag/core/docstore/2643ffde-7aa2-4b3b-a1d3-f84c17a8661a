The tax multiplier reflects the cost of premium taxes and \nrelated assessments.  The expense allowance in the basic premium formula includes target underwriting \nprofit and underwriting expenses (other than premium taxes and assessments that are paid for via the tax \nmultiplier) and expenses that vary with losses.  Since a provision for expenses that vary with losses \n(e.g., loss adjustment expenses) is incorporated in the retro premium formula through the converted losses \nterm, these expenses are eliminated from the basic premium by subtracting out the product of the \nExpected Loss Ratio x (LCF -1.0). \n\u00a0Converted\tLosses\t\nLCF.Losses Reported  Losses Converted \uf0b4\uf03d  \nThe converted losses are the reported losses limited by the selected accident limit (if any) and multiplied \nby the LCF.
