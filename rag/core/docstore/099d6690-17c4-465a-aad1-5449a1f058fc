Therefore, unlike most non-insurance products, the costs \nassociated with an insurance product are not known at the point of sale and as a result need to be \nestimated.  The ratemaking process involves estimating the various components of the fundamental \ninsurance equation to determine whether or not the estimated premium is likely to achieve the target profit \nduring the period the rates will be in effect.     \nIt is common ratemaking practice to use relevant historical experience to estimate the future expected \ncosts that will be used in the fundamental insurance equation; this does not mean actuaries are setting \npremium to recoup past losses.  The first principle in the CAS \u201cStatement of Principles Regarding \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Ratemaking\u201d states that \u201cA rate is an estimate of the expected value of \nfuture costs\u201d (CAS Committee on Ratemaking Principles, p. 6).  Historic costs are only used to the extent \nthat they provide valuable information for estimating future expected costs.  When using historic loss \nexperience, it is important to recognize that adjustments will be necessary to convert this experience into \nthat which will be expected in the future when the rates will be in effect.  For example, if there are \ninflationary pressures that impact losses, the future losses will be higher than the losses incurred during \nthe historical period.  Failure to recognize the increase in losses can lead to an understatement of the \npremium needed to achieve the target profit.   \nThere are many factors that can impact the different components of the fundamental insurance equation \nand that should be considered when using historical experience to assess the adequacy of the current rates.  \nThe following are some items that may necessitate a restatement of the historical experience:", "type": "Document"}}
