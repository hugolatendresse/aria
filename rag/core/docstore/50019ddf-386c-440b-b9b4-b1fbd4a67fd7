The methods \nare divided into two categories:  those that alter the rate calculated from the rating manual and those that \nare employed by insurers to calculate a premium unique to a particular large commercial risk.  The former \ncategory includes experience rating and schedule rating, and the latter category includes loss-rated \ncomposite risks, large deductible policies, and retrospective rating. \n \nChapter 16 discusses the adoption of claims-made policies, with particular attention to the medical \nmalpractice line of business.  This alternative to occurrence policies shortens the time period from \ncoverage inception to claim settlement.  For the ratemaking actuary, this translates to a shorter forecast \nperiod and therefore reduced pricing risk. \n \nAppendices A-D provide illustrative examples of overall rate level analyses for personal automobile, \nhomeowners, medical malpractice, and workers compensation lines of business.  The examples \nincorporate many of the ratemaking concepts and techniques discussed in Chapters 1-8. \n \nAppendices E-F provide illustrative examples of classification ratemaking analysis using the univariate \nand multivariate techniques discussed in Chapters 9 and 10, respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
