Diagnostics can be grounded in statistical theory or can be more \npractical in nature.  Examples of each will be given. \nOne of the most common statistical diagnostics for deciding whether a variable has a systematic effect on \nlosses is the standard errors calculation.  The mathematical concept is beyond the scope of this text, but \n\u201cThe Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Generalized Linear Models\u201d supplies a nice intuitive explanation:  \u201cstandard \nerrors are an indicator of the speed with which the log-likelihood falls from the maximum given a change \nin parameter.\u201d  Two standard errors from the parameter estimates are akin to a 95% confidence interval.  \nThis means the GLM parameter estimate is a point estimate, and the standard errors show the range in \nwhich the modeler can be 95% confident the true answer lies within.  The following graph is identical to \nthe graph shown previously for vehicle symbol but now includes standard error lines for the non-base \nlevels (i.e., +/- two standard errors from the differentials indicated by the GLM).  In this particular case, \nthe upward pattern and narrow standard errors suggest this variable is statistically significant.  Wide \nstandard errors, often straddling unity, might suggest the factor is detecting mostly noise and is worthy of \nelimination from the model.  In this example, symbol 17 shows wide standard errors, but that is mainly a \nfunction of the small volume present in that level.  It does not invalidate the strong results for symbols 1-\n16, where most of the business volume exists.   \n  \n                                                      \n35 This caveat may also be written as \u201call other variables being constant\u201d or \u201call other variables at the base level.\u201d", "type": "Document"}}
