For example, the \nAccident Year 2011 loss cost estimate for the occurrence policies has changed by 1% \n( = ($1,171.70 / $1,160.39) \u2013 1.0).   \nPrinciple\t4\t\nPrinciple 4 states, \u201cClaims-made policies incur no liability for IBNR, so the risk of reserve inadequacy is \ngreatly reduced.\u201d  When pricing occurrence policies, actuaries need to worry about claims that are \nincurred but not reported (pure IBNR) and claims that are incurred but not enough reported (IBNER).  By \ndefinition, claims-made policies do not have a pure IBNR component; therefore, the actuary only has to \ndetermine an IBNER reserve, and the risk of reserve inadequacy is greatly reduced. \nPrinciple\t5\t\nPrinciple 5 states, \u201cThe investment income earned from claims-made policies is substantially less than \nunder occurrence policies.\u201d  Insurers are required to hold funds (i.e., reserves) to cover expected \nliabilities.  Those reserves include unearned premium reserves, case reserves, IBNR reserves, and IBNER \nreserves.  As discussed in Chapter 7, insurers can invest those funds and earn investment income.  \nRelative to the occurrence policy, the claims-made policy shortens the period of time between collection \nof premium and payment of claim; consequently, funds invested for a shorter time horizon result in less \ninvestment income.   \nThis principle has implications on the pricing risk of claims-made policies.  Part of the pricing process is \nthe determination of the underwriting profit that is required to earn a reasonable rate of return after \nconsideration of the investment income earned.  When determining the target underwriting profit \nprovision for a claims-made policy, the pricing actuary should take into consideration both the reduced \ninvestment income as well as the reduced pricing risk. \nDETERMINING\tRATES", "type": "Document"}}
