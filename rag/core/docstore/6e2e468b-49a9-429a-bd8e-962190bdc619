The insurer cedes a portion of the premium (which is the cost \nof the reinsurance).  Common examples of non-proportional reinsurance include catastrophe excess-of-\nloss (e.g., the reinsurer will cover 50% of the losses that exceed $15,000,000 up to $30,000,000 on their \nentire property book of business in the event of a catastrophe) and per risk excess-of-loss reinsurance \n(e.g., the reinsurer will cover for specified risks the portion of any large single event that is between \n$1,000,000 and $5,000,000).   \nTypically, the projected losses are reduced for any expected non-proportional reinsurance recoveries.  Of \ncourse, the cost of purchasing the reinsurance must be included too.  That is typically done by reducing \nthe total premium by the amount ceded to the reinsurer.  Alternatively, the net cost of the non-\nproportional reinsurance (i.e., the cost of the reinsurance minus the expected recoveries) may be included \nas an expense item in the overall rate level indication.", "type": "Document"}}
