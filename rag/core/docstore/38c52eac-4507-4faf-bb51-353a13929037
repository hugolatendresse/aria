Other claims, such as an asbestos claim, may revolve around \ncomplex legal and medical issues and may involve many interested parties. Claim adjustment \nexpenses for an asbestos claim often involve litigation which can lead to high defense costs and \nexpert fees and thus, very high expenses. In some cases, the claim adjustment expenses for \nasbestos claims may be significantly greater than the indemnity payment itself. \n \nHistorically, insurers categorized claim adjustment expenses as allocated loss adjustment \nexpenses (ALAE) and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE).4 ALAE correspond to those \ncosts the insurer is able to assign to a particular claim, such as legal and expert witness expenses \n\u2013 thus, the name allocated loss adjustment expense. ULAE, on the other hand, is not easily \nallocated to a specific claim. Examples of ULAE include the payroll, rent, and computer expenses \nfor the claims department of an insurer.  \n \nWhile actuaries in Canada still separate claim adjustment expenses into ALAE and ULAE, the \nNAIC promulgated two new categorizations of adjustment expenses (effective January 1, 1998) \nfor U.S. insurers reporting on Schedule P5 of the P&C statutory Annual Statement: defense and \ncost containment (DCC) and adjusting and other (A&O). Generally, DCC expenses include all \ndefense litigation and medical cost containment expenses regardless of whether internal or \nexternal to the insurer; A&O expenses include all claims adjusting expenses, whether internal or \nexternal to the insurer.  \n \nThe material in the appendices addresses some of the key professional obligations of U.S. and \nCanadian actuaries that are related to the estimation of unpaid claims as promulgated by the CAS \nand the Academy.
