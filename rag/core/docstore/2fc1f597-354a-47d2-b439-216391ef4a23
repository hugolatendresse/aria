The mechanisms in this section do not modify the manual rate but rather develop a premium for the \nlarge commercial entity.  These mechanisms include loss-rated composite risks, large deductible policies, \nand retrospective rating plans. \nComposite\tRating\t\nIn general, composite rating is an administrative tool used to facilitate the rating of large, complex \ncommercial risks.  It is often used to rate commercial risks when the amount of exposure is difficult to \ntrack throughout the policy period.  The policy premium is calculated at the beginning of the policy term \nbased on estimates for each coverage\u2019s exposure measure along with the relevant rating algorithms for \neach coverage.  Rather than auditing each exposure measure (e.g., sales revenue for general liability, \nproperty value for commercial business property) at the end of the term, a proxy exposure measure is used \nto gauge the overall change in exposure to loss.  For example, if property value is chosen as the proxy \nexposure measure, a 20% increase in property value during the policy term would trigger a premium \nadjustment of 20% for the whole policy\u2019s premium. \n \n15.6 Sched ule Rating Worksheet\nCategory\nAvailable Range \nof Modification \n(Credit to Debit)\nCredit \nApplied\nDebit \nApplied Reason / Basis\nPremises -10% to +10%\n  - General Housekeeping\n  - Preventative Maintenance\n  - Workplace Design\n  - Physical Condition\nClassification -15% to +15%\n  - Exposures not contemplated in class\n  - Hazards peculiar to a classification\n     have been eliminated\n  - Exposure variation due to technology\nMedi cal  Faci l i ti es -5% to +5%\n  - First Aid\n  - Medical Assistance on Site\nSafety Organization -15% to +15%\n  - Written Safety Program\n  - Emergency and Disaster Plans\n  - Loss Control Programs\n  - Ergonomics\nEmpl oye e s -15% to +15%", "type": "Document"}}
