Estimated IBNR \nand estimated total unpaid claims are calculated in Exhibit III, Sheet 3. We compare the results of \nthe expected claims method with the claim development method in Exhibit III, Sheet 4 (projected \nultimate claims) and in Exhibit III, Sheet 5 (estimated IBNR). \n \nIn later chapters, we discuss other approaches for selecting expected claims for XYZ Insurer. \n \n \nWhen the Expected Claims Technique Works and When it Does Not \n \nAs indicated previously, the expected claims method is often used when an insurer is entering a \nnew line of business or a new territory. If actual historical claims experience is not available for \nthe insurer, the actuary may be able to turn to insurance industry benchmarks for claim ratios, \npure premiums, and claim development patterns. Actuaries also use the expected claims \ntechnique for the most recent years in the experience period when the cumulative claim \ndevelopment factors are highly leveraged. \n \nIn addition, the expected claims method is often relied upon when an insurer has experienced \nsignificant change either due to internal factors or external influences. For example, an insurer \nmay decide to use an expected claim ratio method for the latest year in the experience period after \nmajor changes in the legal environment. An increase in the statute of limitations for filing claims \nor expanded coverage due to recent court decisions are examples of changes in the legal \nenvironment that can affect insurers\u2019 claims liabilities. Of course an important assumption in \nusing the expected claim ratio method is that the actuary can estimate a reliable value of the \nexpected claim ratio that takes into account such a changing legal environment for the insurance \ncoverage.", "type": "Document"}}
