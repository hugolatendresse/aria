In this example, we use population as our \nexposure base; historical values are summarized in Column (9) of Exhibit I, Sheet 2. Had we used \nan inflation-sensitive exposure base, such as payroll or sales, we would need to consider the \neffect of inflation over the experience period and possibly introduce an exposure trend to adjust \nall exposures to the common economic value of 2008 exposures. \n \nFor GL Self-Insurer, we assume that the only adjustment to claims is for trend, and that the \nannual claim trend rate is 7.5%. Again this trend incorporates both severity and frequency trends \nfor the jurisdiction in which coverage is provided. An alternative to trending claims and \nexposures separately when the exposures are inflation-sensitive is to use a residual pure premium \ntrend rate. For example, in U.S. workers compensation, actuaries frequently use a residual pure \npremium trend that represents the trend in claims that is in excess of the trend in payroll. \n \nAfter a review of the trended pure premiums in Column (12) and various averages in Line (13), \nwe select a pure premium for accident year 2008 of $3.50 per person. We calculate expected \nclaims of $2,765,000 by multiplying the selected pure premium of $3.50 by the 2008 population \n(790,000). The total unpaid claim estimate is equal to expected claims less paid claims, and \nestimated IBNR is equal to expected claims less reported claims. \n \n \n134", "type": "Document"}}
