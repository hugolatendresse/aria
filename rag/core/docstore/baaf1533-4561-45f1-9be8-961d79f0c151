One approach is to separate the data by currency and then combine it \nafter translating it using the appropriate exchange rates at a common point in time. For example, \nassume that claims data are in Euros, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars; if the actuary is \nconducting an analysis that requires a final unpaid claim estimate in Euros, the actuary could then \nconvert all amounts to Euros using current exchange rates.  \n \n \nLarge Claims \n \nWhen conducting analyses of unpaid claims, it is important for actuaries to be aware of how large \nclaims influence the various estimation techniques. As we will see in a later part of this book, the \npresence of unusually large claims can distort some of the methods used for estimating unpaid \nclaims. In these situations, the actuary may choose to exclude the large claims from the initial \nprojection and then, at the end of the unpaid claims analysis, add a case specific projection for the \nreported portion of large claims and a smoothed provision for the IBNR portion of large claims. \nIn Part 3, we discuss alternative approaches that the actuary may use to adjust the estimation \ntechniques for large claims. \n \nThe determination of the size criteria of a large claim is not a precise science. It may vary by line \nof business, by geographic region, and even between analyses of unpaid claims. Actuarial \njudgment is critical in determining how to adjust the analyses for large claims.
