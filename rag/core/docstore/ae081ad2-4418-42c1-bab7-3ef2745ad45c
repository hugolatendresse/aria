This is particularly vital with respect to the type of paid \nclaims and claim count statistics that are used in frequency-severity methods. Does the paid \nclaims data include significant partial payments? Do you have claim count statistics for the \nnumber of paid claims or only closed claim counts? If only closed counts are available, is it \nreasonable to calculate an average paid value using paid claims that contain substantial partial \npayments? How are reopened claims treated in the claims database? In some systems, they may \nappear as a negative reported claim count or as a new claim. The actuary must determine, based \non his or her knowledge of the claims data available and the consistency of such data over time, \nwhat types of data are most appropriate for each of the different methods.  \n \nThe examples presented in this chapter ignore the effect of reopened claims. Depending on how \nreopened claims are handled within the insurer\u2019s systems (e.g., is the claim assigned the original \nclaim identification number or a new claim identification number?) there could be distortions in \nthe claim count statistics due to reopened claims. This could affect both frequency and severity \nindications. Reopened claims are more prevalent in some lines of insurance, such as U.S. workers \ncompensation and Canadian automobile accident benefits, than other lines. Depending on the \nmethod in which the insurer\u2019s claims and information reporting systems handles reopened claims \nand the volume of reopenings, the actuary may choose to segregate reopened claims from other \nclaims and analyze reopened claims separately. \n \n \n                                                 \n68 PCAS, 1978. \n213", "type": "Document"}}
