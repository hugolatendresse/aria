The non-geographic variables \ninclude many traditional rating variables (e.g., age of insured, claim history) as well as other explanatory \nvariables that may not currently be used in rating.  The geographic variables can include geo-demographic \nvariables (e.g., population density) and geo-physical variables (e.g., average rainfall).  The geo-\ndemographic and geo-physical variables are often obtained from third-party sources and merged with the \ninsurance company database via some geographic unit, although it does not have to be the same as the \nselected basic geographic unit.  \n  \n                                                      \n37 The same comments made in Chapter 9 regarding this bias apply.
