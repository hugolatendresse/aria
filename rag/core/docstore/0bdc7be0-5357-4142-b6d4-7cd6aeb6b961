Many actuaries also use this method for estimating unpaid claims for the most \nimmature period(s). Expected claims are a critical component of several other methods including \nthe Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod techniques, which we discuss in Chapters 9 and 10.  \n \n \nKey Assumption \n \nThe key assumption of the expected claims technique is that the actuary can better estimate total \nunpaid claims based on an a priori (or initial) estimate than from claims experience observed to \ndate. In certain circumstances, the claims experience reported to date may provide little \ninformation about ultimate claims, especially when compared to the a priori estimate. \n \n \nCommon Uses of the Expected Claims Method  \n \nActuaries can use the expected claims method with all lines of insurance. However, this method \nis more commonly used in lines of business with longer emergence patterns and settlement \npatterns. The method can be used with data organized by accident year, report year, policy year, \nunderwriting year, and even with calendar year data. The expected claims method is often used \nwhen: \n \n\uf0be An insurer enters a new line of business or a new territory \n \n\uf0be Operational or environmental changes make recent historical data irrelevant for projecting \nfuture claims activity for that cohort of claims \n \n\uf0be The claim development method is not appropriate for less mature periods since the \ndevelopment factors to ultimate are too highly leveraged \n \n\uf0be Data is unavailable for other methods \n \n \nMechanics of the Expected Claims Technique \n \nThere are numerous ways for actuaries to determine the a priori expected claims. Some of the \napproaches are mathematically simple and some involve complex statistical modeling. The", "type": "Document"}}
