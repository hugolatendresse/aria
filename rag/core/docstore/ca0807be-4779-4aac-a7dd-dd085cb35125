The following two formulae represent the \nreported and paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, respectively: \n \nUltimate Claims = Actual Reported Claims + Expected Unreported Claims \nUltimate Claims = Actual Reported Claims + (Expected Claims) x (% Unreported)  \n \nUltimate Claims = Actual Paid Claims + Expected Unpaid Claims \nUltimate Claims = Actual Paid Claims + (Expected Claims) x (% Unpaid)  \n \nSince actual reported and paid claims are both known quantities, the challenge of the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method is to calculate the expected unreported and expected unpaid claims. \nIn order to complete the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, the actuary must select claim \ndevelopment patterns and develop an expected claims estimate. \n \nIn our step-by-step example of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, we use the cumulative claim \ndevelopment patterns presented in Chapter 7 and the expected claims developed in Chapter 8.54 In \nExhibit I, Sheet 1, we present both the reported and paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson projections for \nU.S. Industry Auto. \n \nThe second column of Exhibit I, Sheet 1, contains the expected claims developed in Chapter 8 for \nU.S. Industry Auto. Columns (3) and (4) are the selected cumulative claim development factors \ndescribed in Chapter 7. We convert the cumulative claim development patterns to percentage \nunreported and percentage unpaid in Columns (5) and (6), respectively. The percentage reported", "type": "Document"}}
