As additional information about a claim becomes available, the \nestimated value of the claim will likely change. (We demonstrate this point later in the chapter with \na detailed example.) \n \nThere are several different approaches commonly used by insurers to set case outstanding. These \ndifferent approaches may best be understood with an example. Assume a claim is reported under a \nmedical malpractice policy with a policy limit of $1 million. One of the most common approaches \nis to establish the case outstanding based on the best estimate of the ultimate settlement value of \nsuch a claim including consideration of future inflationary forces. Other insurers may set the case \noutstanding based on the maximum value, which would be the policy limit of $1 million. Another \napproach is for the claims adjuster to seek the advice of legal counsel. Assume that the legal \ncounsel estimates that there is an 80% chance that the claim will settle without any payment and a \n20% chance of a full policy limit claim. Some insurers may then set the case outstanding based on \nthe mode, which would be $0; and others may set the case outstanding based on the expected value \ncalculation or $200,000 [(80% x $0) + (20% x $1 million)]. \n \nInsurers differ in their practices with respect to the establishment of case outstanding for claim \nadjustment expenses. While some insurers establish case outstanding for the estimated claim \namount only; others establish case outstanding for the estimated claim amount and all claim-\nrelated expenses.
