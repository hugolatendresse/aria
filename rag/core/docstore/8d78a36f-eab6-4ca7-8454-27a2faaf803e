Actuaries often use the term \u201ctrend\u201d to describe \ninflation and other systematic influences on the claims or premiums or both. In this example, the \nonly trend reflected is inflation in claims. Through the use of trend factors we adjust historical \nclaims to the economic value that would be reported if that same claim occurred in accident year \n2008. Another way of looking at the trend adjustment is to say that we are restating the value of \nthe historical claims in 2008 dollars. \n \nIn our example we use a 14.5% annual claim trend rate for automobile bodily injury liability \nclaims. This trend incorporates both severity and frequency trends for this particular line of \ninsurance in the particular jurisdiction in which the coverage is written. Trend rates can vary \nsignificantly by line of business and by geographic region. Trends can be negative for some lines \nof business and above 20% for other lines of business. Trends can also vary for different periods \nof time within the experience period. If the actuary is going to use the historical experience of the \ninsurer to determine an expected claim ratio, it is critical to incorporate the effect of claim trends \nin the analysis.  \n \nThe second adjustment in our example for Auto BI Insurer is a tort reform adjustment. It is not \nuncommon for states and provinces to legislate changes to the legal environment for lawsuits \narising out of private passenger automobile accidents. In such situations, historical claims need to \nbe restated as if they occurred in the new legal environment. In our example, there was a \nsignificant reform implemented during 2004. When multiplying historical claims by a reform \nadjustment factor of 0.67, we are removing 33% of the claims for the oldest years in the \nexperience period. In essence we are saying that if the same type of claims that occurred in 2000", "type": "Document"}}
