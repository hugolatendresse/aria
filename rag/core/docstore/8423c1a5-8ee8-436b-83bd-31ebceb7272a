Of course, profit is only achieved if the product is \nactually sold.  Additionally, there is a certain amount of fixed cost (e.g., building costs) that does not vary \nsignificantly regardless of the number of policies sold.  For these reasons, companies should consider the \ndemand for the product being priced.  The following figure depicts a typical demand curve, demonstrating \nthat the demand for a product decreases as the price increases.   \n \nTo determine the true expected profitability, the two curves should be considered simultaneously.  As \nshown in Figure 13.6, expected profit as a function of price is an arc-shaped curve.", "type": "Document"}}
