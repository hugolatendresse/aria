For example, policy year 2008 refers to all policies \nwith beginning effective dates between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. For annual \npolicies with a January 1, 2008 beginning effective date, covered claims will have accident dates \nbetween January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008.

Insurers differ in their \npractices as to how such policies are coded in the information systems. Some insurers split the single multi-\nyear policy into annual pieces and code this type of policy as multiple annual policies. Other insurers may \nfollow different practices. The important point is that the actuary must understand the process for recording \npremium and claims associated with multi-year policies (to the extent such policies exist in the insurer\u2019s \nportfolio). \n41", "type": "Document"}}
