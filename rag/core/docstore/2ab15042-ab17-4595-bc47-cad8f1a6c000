Of course, other considerations (e.g., marketing, \noperational, and regulatory) may cause management to implement a rating algorithm other than what is \nindicated by the actuary\u2019s analysis. \nSome very large risks have a significant amount of individual experience.  For example, a multi-billion \ndollar manufacturing corporation may purchase insurance for various plants for property damage, \ncommercial liability, and workers compensation.  For these risks, it may be possible for an insurer to use \nthe risk\u2019s individual historical experience to reasonably estimate the amount of premium required for a \nfuture policy term.  Such risks are priced using rating techniques covered in Chapter 15.  For most \ninsurance products, however, it is not feasible to set rates for an individual risk using solely the historical \nexperience of that individual risk.  In such cases, risks must be analyzed via classification ratemaking, \nwhich is the process of grouping risks with similar loss potential and charging different manual rates to \nreflect differences in loss potential among the groups. \nThe first stage of classification ratemaking involves determining which risk criteria effectively segment \nrisks into groups with similar expected loss experience.  For example, a homeowners insurer may \nrecognize that the expected loss for a homeowners policy varies materially based on the age of the home.  \nThe characteristic being examined is often referred to as a rating variable.
