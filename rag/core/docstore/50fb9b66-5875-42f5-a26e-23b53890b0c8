Primary insurers generally sell policies with a wide variety of policy limits.  Some of the \nindividual policy limits fall below the attachment point, and some extend beyond the top of the excess \nlayer.  The implication is that each policy\u2019s limit and increased limit factor needs to be considered in the \ncalculation of the complement.   \nFor this approach the actuary analyzes the policies at each limit of coverage separately.  The actuary \ncalculates the estimated losses in a given layer using the premium volume and expected loss ratio in that \nlayer.  Then the actuary performs an increased limits factor analysis on each first dollar limit\u2019s loss costs \nseparately.  The formula for the complement of credibility is as follows: \n\uf028 \uf029,ILF\nILFILFLR\n)min(\nAd d\nALd,A\ndPC \uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf0b3\n\uf0e5\n \nwhere   \n\uf0b7 LR= Total limits loss ratio, \n\uf0b7 Pd= Total premium for policies with limit d. \n\uf0b7 The ILFs have the same meaning as previously discussed. \nThe following shows an example of the calculation of the expected loss for the layer between $500,000 \nand $750,000 assuming a total limits loss ratio of 60%. \n\t\n12.7 E xamp le Calculation for Limits Ap p roach\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)\nLimit of \nLiability (d ) P r e m i u m  \nExpected \nLos s  Ratio\n Expected Total \nLos s es  \nILF @ \nd\nILF @ \nA\nILF @ \nA+L\n% Loss \nIn Layer\nExpected \nLos s  in \nLayer\n100,000$      1,000,000$         60.0% 600,000 $           1.00 2.50 3.00 0.0% - $             \n250,000$      500,000 $            60.0% 300,000 $           1.75 2.50 3.00 0.0% - $             \n500,000$      200,000 $            60.0% 120,000 $           2.50 2.50 3.00 0.0% - $", "type": "Document"}}
