Such \nverification of the treatment of large claims is an important part of ensuring that the ceded and/or \nnet claim triangles are correct. In Exhibit II, Sheet 2, we present three triangles for an insurer who \nmaintains $1 million excess of loss reinsurance. In accident year 2005, the insurer sustained two \nlarge claims in excess of $1 million, and in accident year 2007, one large claim in excess of $1 \nmillion. We present the gross, net, and ceded reported claim triangles in Exhibit II, Sheet 2. \n \nDuring the analysis, the actuary should ensure that key assumptions, particularly those involving \nactuarial judgment, are consistent between the gross and net or gross and ceded analyses. For \nexample, it is generally not reasonable for the tail factor to be larger for net claims than for gross \nclaims. Since net claims are often capped due to excess or aggregate coverage, we frequently \nobserve net claim development patterns that are less than or equal to gross claim development \npatterns.80  \n \nActuaries differ in their practice with respect to the order in which they choose gross or net claim \ndevelopment factors. Some actuaries first select gross claim development factors since these \ntriangles contain a greater volume of claims experience, and thus may be considered to have \ngreater credibility. The gross claim development factors may then be used as input for the \nselection of ceded or net claim development factors. On the other hand, it may be that gross \n                                                 \n80 This relationship does not hold in some circumstances, such as for an insurance company fronting for a \ncaptive insurer (where the captive assumes the working layer and the fronting company retains the excess \nlayer). There are also situations in which the effect of limiting large claims due to excess coverage may \nresult in net factors that are greater than gross factors. \n331", "type": "Document"}}
