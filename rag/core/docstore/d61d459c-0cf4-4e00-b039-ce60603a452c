In Exhibit IV, Sheet 1, we summarize the calendar \nyear and accident year experience data from their example and have named it PQR Insurer.  \n \nOver the course of its six years of operations, paid ULAE averaged approximately 18% of \nclaims. Observing the downward trend in the paid-to-paid ratios in Exhibit IV, Sheet 2, \nColumn (6), an actuary using the traditional technique may select a ULAE ratio of 16% and \nderive estimated unpaid ULAE of $41.6 million. In Column (7), we use the Kittel refinement \nand estimate unpaid ULAE of $29.9 million. \n \nFor PQR Insurer, Conger and Nolibos found that ULAE expenditures are concentrated more \nheavily towards the front end of the claim than are the claim payments. Consider a \nhypothetical extreme, in which all ULAE is incurred at the moment the claim occurs, with the \namount of the ULAE being proportional to the size of the claim. In this hypothetical situation, \nthe appropriate relationship to examine would be the ratio of ULAE to ultimate claims for an \naccident period.111 They also observe that the growth of PQR Insurer will result in an \noverstatement of the estimated unpaid ULAE using the traditional technique. \n \nInterviews with management of PQR Insurer and examination of the flows of work and \nallocation of resources in the claims department suggested that approximately 60% to 70% of \nthe work for a claim is concentrated at the time the claim is reported, and 30% to 40% of the \nwork is spread over the remaining life of the claim. For PQR Insurer, no particular extra \ndegree of effort is required to close the claim. Since ULAE expenditures are heavier at the", "type": "Document"}}
