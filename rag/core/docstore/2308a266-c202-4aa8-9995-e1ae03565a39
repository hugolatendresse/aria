Ronald Wiser notes in \u201cLoss Reserving\u201d84 that the attempt to reconcile \na number of different estimates is extremely difficult, but often yields important new insights for \nthe actuary.  \n \nAn important final check of the selected ultimate claims, particularly for the most recent years, \nshould include calculation of claim ratios, severities, pure premiums, and claim frequencies. Such \na review is consistent with Mr. Wiser\u2019s recommendations that proposed ultimate amounts be \nevaluated in contexts outside their original frame of analysis. If exposures are not available, the \nactuary can compare ultimate claim counts with premiums as a proxy for frequency. Another \nvaluable test for the actuary is the implied average case outstanding and unreported claim on open \nand unreported claims. The actuary should review these statistics for reasonableness from the \nperspective of year-to-year changes, knowledge gained from meetings with management, and \nknowledge of the industry in general. Such review should either result in the actuary having \ngreater confidence in the unpaid claim estimate or lead the actuary to seek additional information \nbefore reaching a conclusion. \n \nIn Chapters 7 through 14, we present numerous examples for insurers and self-insurers providing \ncoverage for many different lines of insurance. In the following sections of this chapter, we \nreview the results for many of these examples. We conclude this chapter with a brief discussion \nof monitoring and interim testing of unpaid claim estimates. \n \n \nU.S. Industry Auto \n \nFor U.S. Industry Auto, the results of the various projection techniques are all quite consistent.", "type": "Document"}}
