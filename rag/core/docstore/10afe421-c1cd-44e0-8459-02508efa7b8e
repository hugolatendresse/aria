The next step is to calculate the ratios of incremental paid claims to previous case \noutstanding (Exhibit II, Sheet 2) and the ratios of case outstanding to previous case outstanding \n(Exhibit II, Sheet 3). As a result of the various operational and environmental changes noted in \nour discussions with management and our previous diagnostic review, we select ratios based on \nthe latest two years of experience in an attempt to reflect the most current operating environment \nfor XYZ Insurer. \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheet 4, we complete the square for both case outstanding and incremental paid \nclaims. Projected ultimate claims using the case outstanding development technique are based on \nthe cumulative paid claims through all maturities. We summarize projected ultimate claims in \nColumn (4) of Exhibit II, Sheet 5 and calculate estimated IBNR and the total unpaid claim \nestimate in Columns (6) and (7), respectively. We compare the results of the case outstanding \ndevelopment technique method with the frequency-severity method, the Cape Cod method, the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method, the expected claims method, and the development method in \nExhibit II, Sheet 6 (projected ultimate claims) and in Exhibit II, Sheet 7 (estimated IBNR). \n \n \nWhen the Case Outstanding Development Technique Works and When it Does Not \n \nThere are several limitations with the use of the case outstanding development technique. First, as \nnoted earlier in this chapter, an important assumption underlying this method is that future IBNR \nis related to claims already reported. This assumption does not hold true for many P&C lines of \ninsurance. Other limitations, also referred to earlier, are the infrequent use and the absence of \nbenchmark data (for accident year applications of this method).
