For example, the basic limit for personal automobile liability insurance typically equals the \namount of insurance required by the financial responsibility laws.  As many insureds voluntarily select \nhigher limits of insurance, large insurers may have a significant number of losses that exceed the basic \nlimit.     \nWhen the losses are not capped at the basic limit, the actuary must determine the large loss threshold that \nbest balances the following goals:  including as many losses as possible and minimizing the volatility in \nthe ratemaking analysis.  One approach is to examine the size of loss distribution and set the threshold at a \ngiven percentile, such as the 99th percentile.  This can be done by examining individual claim sizes in \nincreasing order and choosing the claim amount for which 99% of the claim inventory is below that \namount.  Alternatively, a threshold can be chosen with respect to a certain percentage of losses rather than \nclaim counts.  For some insurance products, the amount of insurance varies based on the value of the \n                                                      \n17 As discussed in Chapter 8, rate level indications can be performed on a loss ratio or pure premium basis.  Only the \nloss ratio method uses premiums in the calculation; therefore, this adjustment to basic limits premium is only \nnecessary if performing a loss ratio indication.", "type": "Document"}}
