In Column (13), we present the trended adjusted claim ratios, \nwhich are equal to the trended adjusted claims divided by the on-level earned premiums. We then \ntake various averages of the claim ratios in Line (14). We observe that the claim development \nfactors to ultimate for both reported and paid claims are highly leveraged for the most recent \naccident years. The reported claim development factors to ultimate for accident years 2007 and \n2008 are 2.90 and 4.00, respectively; and the paid claim development factors to ultimate for \naccident years 2007 and 2008 are 15.00 and 90.00. Thus, we look at various averages that do not \ninclude the experience of the most recent years. In Line (15) we select a claim ratio of 80% based \non a review of the individual projected claim ratios in Column (13) and the averages in Line (14).  \n \nThe final two steps in our example are to project accident year 2008 expected claims and to \ndetermine the unpaid claim estimate. The expected claims of $49.6 million (Line (16)) are equal \nto the selected claim ratio of 80% multiplied by the earned premium of $62 million. We calculate \nthe estimate of unpaid claims by subtracting paid claims for accident year 2008 from the expected \nclaims. The total unpaid claim estimate includes both case outstanding and the broad definition of \nIBNR. Estimated IBNR is equal to the expected claims less reported claims. \n \n \nStep-by-Step Example \u2013 GL Self-Insurer \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheet 2, we present a similar calculation for a public entity self-insurer\u2019s general \nliability program (GL Self-Insurer).
