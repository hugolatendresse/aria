The first approach, presented in Exhibit II, Sheet 9, is based on a linear regression of the \nclaim development factors at each maturity age with the accident year. We show the Y intercepts, \nslope, and R-squared values for each maturity age. The second approach, shown in Exhibit II, \nSheet 10, is similar to the first except that the development factors are derived using an \nexponential regression analysis rather than a linear regression analysis. As we see in the middle \nsection of both Sheets, the R-squared values are never greater than 75% for any maturity age. We \nuse the extrapolated claim development factors to complete the age-to-age triangles in order to \nderive the ultimate claim development factor for each accident year.77 \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheet 11, we project ultimate claims based on the unadjusted and adjusted paid \nclaim development triangles. The projections based on the unadjusted paid claim triangle rely on \nthe all-year volume-weighted average age-to-age factors. For the adjusted paid claims, we project \nclaims using the all-year volume-weighted average as well as the development factors derived \nfrom the linear and exponential regression analyses. In Exhibit II, Sheet 12, we calculate the \nunpaid claim estimates based on the results of the four claims projections. The estimated IBNR \nbased on the adjusted paid claims projections are relatively close to one another; these estimates \nare all roughly $10 million greater than the estimates from the unadjusted development technique. \n \n \nPotential Difficulty with the Adjustment \n \nA key assumption in the Berquist-Sherman paid claims adjustment is that a higher percentage of \nclosed claim counts relative to ultimate claim counts is associated with a higher percentage of", "type": "Document"}}
