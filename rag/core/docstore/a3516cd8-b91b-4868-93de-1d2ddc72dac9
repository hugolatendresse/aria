To the extent that information is available, the \nprocedure is practical.  In terms of acceptability, however, this estimate is more logically related to the \ndata below the attachment point (which is used for the projection) than to the data in the layer, and this \nmay be controversial. \nLower\tLimits\tAnalysis\t\nThe complement discussed above uses losses capped at the attachment point to estimate the losses in the \nexcess layer being priced.  If those losses are too sparse to be reliable, the actuary may prefer to use losses \ncapped at a limit lower than the attachment point.  This lower limit can often be the basic limit.   \nThe formula for this complement is:   \n,\nILF\nILFILF\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d \uf02b\nd\nALA\ndLC\n \nwhere \n\uf0b7 dL are the losses capped at the lower limit, d; \n\uf0b7 ILFA is the increased limits factor for the attachment point A; \n\uf0b7 ILFd  is the increased limits factor for the lower limit, d. \n\uf0b7 ILFA+L is the increased limits factor for the sum of the attachment point A and the excess insurer\u2019s \nlimit of liability L (i.e., this sum represents the top of the excess layer being priced). \nNote that the first excess procedure is a special case of this procedure where the lower limit, d, is equal to \nthe attachment point. \nFor example, calculate the complement of credibility for the layer between $500,000 and $750,000.  \nAssume the losses capped at $250,000 are $1,500,000, and the increased limits factors from Table 12.6 \napply.
