The claims-made coverage only covers claims that occur \non or after the retroactive date.  To provide complete coverage without overlap, the retroactive date \nshould be coordinated with the expiration of the last occurrence policy. \nWhen the retroactive date is applied to Figure 16.6, the result is Figure 16.7.  The insured can purchase a \nfirst-year claims-made policy in 2011 with a retroactive date of January 1, 2011.  The first-year claims-\nmade policy will only provide coverage for claims that occurred on or after January 1, 2011, and were \nreported in 2011 (i.e., L(2011,0)).  A second-year claims-made policy with a retroactive date of January 1, \n2011, will cover L(2012,0) and L(2012,1).  This continues until a mature claims-made policy is issued in \n2015. \n  \nThe rating of claims-made policies employs a factor to recognize the growth in exposure for each \nsuccessive claims-made policy during the transition; this factor is known as the step factor.  The step \nfactor is a percentage of the mature claims-made rate.  Determination of the appropriate step factors \nrequires an evaluation of the expected reporting lag and the various factors affecting claim costs during \n16.6 Comp arison of 2010 Claims-M ad e and  Occurrence Policies\n01234\n2010 L(2010,0) L(2010,1) L(2010,2) L(2010,3) L(2010,4)\n2011 L(2011,0) L(2011,1) L(2011,2) L(2011,3) L(2011,4)\n2012 L(2012,0) L(2012,1) L(2012,2) L(2012,3) L(2012,4)\n2013 L(2013,0) L(2013,1) L(2013,2) L(2013,3) L(2013,4)\n2014 L(2014,0) L(2014,1) L(2014,2) L(2014,3) L(2014,4)\n2015 L(2015,0) L(2015,1) L(2015,2) L(2015,3) L(2015,4)\nClaims -made = enclos ed by dotted rectangle\nOccurrence Policy = shaded\nReport Year Lag\nReport Year\n16.7 Coord inating the Sw itch from Occurrence to Claims-M ad e Policy\n01234\n2010 L(2010,0) L(2010,1) L(2010,2) L(2010,3) L(2010,4)", "type": "Document"}}
