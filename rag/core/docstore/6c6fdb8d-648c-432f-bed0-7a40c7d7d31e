The minimum premium requirement is \nintended to ensure that, on an individual risk basis, premium covers the expected fixed expenses plus \nsome minimum expected loss, as determined by the company.  In most cases, companies that use a \nminimum premium requirement do not have additive fixed expense fees in their rating algorithms.  \nImplementation of a minimum premium requirement can effectively increase total premium.  The effect is \ncalculated as follows:   \n.0.1Minimum Without  Premium\nMinimum With  PremiumEffect \uf02d\uf03d  \nTo offset this increase in premium, the otherwise applicable base rate should be multiplied by the \nfollowing factor: \n.Effect1.0\n1.0FactorOffset \uf02b\uf03d  \nLimiting\tthe\tPremium\tEffect\tof\ta\tSingle\tVariable\t\t\nIn practice, actuaries may decide to limit the premium impact caused by the change in rate differentials \nfor a single rating variable.
