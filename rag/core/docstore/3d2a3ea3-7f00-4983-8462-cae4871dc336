In Part 2, Chapter 5, we describe how to create and use \ndevelopment triangles.  \n \nIn Part 3, we explore basic techniques for estimating unpaid claims. We generally rely on examples \nbased on the actual experience of insurers in the U.S. and Canada. (See further description \nregarding examples later in this chapter.) We use similar portfolios of insurance in successive \nchapters to allow a comparison of the results from different techniques. A changing environment, \nsuch as an increase in claim ratios, a shift in the strength of case outstanding, and a change in \nproduct mix, can have a pronounced effect on the accuracy of the estimation technique. In this part, \nwe demonstrate through detailed examples the impact of various changes on each of the \nmethodologies for estimating unpaid claims. We conclude Part 3 with an evaluation of all the \nmethods presented in the previous chapters. In the final chapter for this part, we also discuss on-\ngoing monitoring of unpaid claim estimates. \n \nThe purpose of Part 4 is to present techniques for estimating unpaid claim adjustment expenses. \nClaim adjustment expenses are the costs of administering, determining coverage for, settling, or \ndefending claims even if it is ultimately determined that the claim is invalid.
