The estimated case outstanding value can turn out to be too \nhigh or too low, although it is reasonable in light of the information available at the time when the \nclaims professional sets the estimate.  \n \nA third characteristic is that an insured claim can have many different types of payments \nassociated with it. In our example, the insurer makes an initial claim payment to the injured party \non April 1, 2009. This claim payment provides for out-of-pocket medical expenses reported by \nthe claimant. Since the insurer questioned the validity of the claim, they hired an IA; as a result, \nthere was a payment of $500 for the IA\u2019s services on May 1, 2009.  (Insurers in the U.S. would \nclassify this type of expense as A&O; in Canada, they would categorize this expense as ALAE.) \nOn March 1, 2010, the insurer makes another payment of $24,000 to the claimant for lost wages \nand additional medical expenses. At this time, the insurer assumes this to be the final payment. \nRoughly one year later, a claims professional reopens the claim. Over the course of the following \nyear, the insurer makes further payments for defense litigation, additional lost wages, and medical \nexpenses. \n \nA fourth characteristic of insured claims is that there are many dates associated with each claim: \n \n\uf0be Policy effective date is the date the insurer issues the insurance policy (December 1, 2007) \n \n\uf0be Accident date, or date of loss, is the date the covered injury occurs (November 15, 2008) \n \n\uf0be Report date is the date the insurer receives notice of the claim (February 20, 2009) \n \n\uf0be Transaction date is the date on which either a case outstanding transaction takes place or a \npayment is made (see all the dates in the preceding table)", "type": "Document"}}
