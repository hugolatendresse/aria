These \nexpenses include general expenses, other acquisition expenses, commissions and brokerage, and taxes, \nlicenses, and fees.  While it may be possible to assign some of these expenses \u2014like commissions \u2014to \nspecific policies, most of these expenses cannot be assigned.  For example, general expenses include \nsome of the costs associated with the company\u2019s buildings, and other acquisition expenses include items \nlike advertising costs.   \nLoss adjustment expenses (LAE) are expenses incurred in the process of settling claims. \nAllocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) are directly attributable to a specific claim and are, \ntherefore, captured on the claim extract.   \nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), on the other hand, cannot be assigned to a specific \nclaim.  ULAE include items like the cost of a claim center or salaries of employees responsible for \nmaintaining claims records.  Since ULAE cannot be assigned to a specific claim, these too are tracked at \nthe aggregate level. \nGenerally speaking, companies track the underwriting and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid by \ncalendar year.  Further subdivision to items such as line of business and state may also be approximated.  \nThese aggregate figures can be used to determine expense provisions that will be used in the ratemaking \nprocess. \nDATA\tAGGREGATION\t\nThe aforementioned policy, claim, and accounting databases must be aggregated for use in the ratemaking \nanalysis.  By maintaining data at a detailed level, the data can be aggregated in a variety of ways to \nsupport the different types of analyses described within this text.  This section is intended to provide some \nbasics of aggregating data.  More detailed descriptions will be provided in later chapters.   \nWhen aggregating data for ratemaking purposes, three general objectives apply: \n\uf0b7 Accurately match losses and premium for the policy", "type": "Document"}}
