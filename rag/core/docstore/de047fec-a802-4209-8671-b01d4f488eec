Reduce the bulk (i.e., IBNR) reserve a corresponding amount (because \nyou sense an acceleration in the rate of report); \n \n2. Leave the bulk reserve at the same percentage level of expected losses \n(because you sense a random fluctuation such as a large loss); or \n \n3. Increase the bulk reserve in proportion to the increase of actual reported \nover expected reported (because you don\u2019t have 100% confidence in \nyour \u201cexpected losses\u201d)? \n \nObviously, none of the three suggested \u201canswers\u201d is satisfactory without further \nextensive investigation, and yet, all are reasonable.87 \n \nWhile his comments are directed at limitations in the expected claims component of the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique, in our opinion they are more applicable to an actuary \nmonitoring unpaid claims and trying to determine the consequences that differences in expected \nand actual claims will have on the unpaid claim estimate. As Mr. White notes, there is no single \n\u201csatisfactory\u201d answer as to how an increase in reported claims should be addressed in establishing \nthe unpaid claim estimate. In an effort to best understand the drivers underlying the greater-than-\nexpected claims, the actuary must seek a comprehensive understanding of the specific situation. \nSuch understanding can be achieved through meetings with management and other parties who \nunderstand the situation at-hand and through detailed analyses of the claims and claims \nexperience.\n                                                 \n87 PCAS, 1973. \n353", "type": "Document"}}
