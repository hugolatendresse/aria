Columns (2) through (4) are based on the \ncalendar year historical experience presented in Exhibit IV, Sheet 1. The claims basis in \nColumn (5) is equal to 60% of the ultimate on claims reported in the year (R) and 40% of paid \nclaims (C). The ULAE ratio in Column (6) is equal to paid ULAE in column (2) divided by \nthe claims basis in Column (5). A ULAE ratio of 10% is selected based on a review of the \nhistorical experience by year. The estimated unpaid ULAE is calculated in Line (9) using the \nthree approaches described in the previous section: \n \n\uf0b7 Expected claim method = [(selected ULAE ratio x ultimate claims) \u2013 total paid ULAE to \ndate] \n \n\uf0b7 Bornhuetter-Ferguson method = [selected ULAE ratio x (ultimate claims \u2013 total claims \nbasis)] \n \n\uf0b7 Development method = {[(ultimate claims / total claims basis) \u2013 1.00] x total paid ULAE \nto date} \n \n                                                 \n111 The reader should recognize elements of the suggested simplification of the generalized method in the \ndiscussion of this extreme situation. \n407", "type": "Document"}}
