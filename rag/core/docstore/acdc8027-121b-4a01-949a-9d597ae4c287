Deductibles minimize the occurrence of these small \nnuisance claims.  By doing this, insurers can better control LAE and keep the rates lower than \nwould otherwise be possible.   \n\uf0b7 Provides incentive for loss control:  Since the insured is responsible for the first layer of loss, \nthe insured has a financial incentive to avoid losses. \n\uf0b7 Controls catastrophic exposure:  When an insurer writes a significant number of policies in a \ngiven area, the insurer may be susceptible to very large aggregate losses in the case of a \ncatastrophic event.  By including large catastrophe deductibles, the insurer can significantly \nreduce overall exposure to such losses and reduce the overall risk of insolvency.         \nLoss\tElimination\tRatio\t(LER)\tApproach\t\nIt is possible to group data by deductible and use the techniques described in Chapters 9 and 10 to \ndetermine rate relativities for each deductible amount.  Alternatively, actuaries have determined \ndeductible relativities using a loss elimination ratio (LER) approach.   \n                                                      \n38 A third type of deductible, used in a small number of insurance products (e.g., crop hail insurance) is the \ndisappearing deductible.  With a disappearing deductible, the insured is still responsible for the first dollars of loss.  \nHowever, this amount decreases, or disappears, as the size of the claim increases until at a certain point the insured\u2019s \nretained losses are zero.  Since this type of deductible is not commonly used in practice today, this text will not \nfurther address disappearing deductibles.", "type": "Document"}}
