For existing insurance products, it is important that companies track policy \nand claim data at the individual policy, risk, or risk segment level.  By doing so, companies have the \nflexibility to aggregate data in different ways (e.g., calendar year, accident year, policy year, report year) \nand determine the granularity of the data needed depending on the type of analysis being performed (e.g., \noverall rate level analysis or classification analysis).   \nCompanies often consider external data, if available.  More specifically, companies may examine data \nfrom statistical plans and data calls, other aggregated insurance data, competitor rate filings, and data \nfrom other third-party sources.  These types of data can be useful in pricing new lines of business or in \nsupplementing internal data.", "type": "Document"}}
