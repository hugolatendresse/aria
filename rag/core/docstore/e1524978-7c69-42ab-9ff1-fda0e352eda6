Actuaries may also consider count-\nbased allocation methods that assume the same kinds of transactions cost the same amount regardless of \nthe dollar amount of the claim, and that there is a cost associated with a claim remaining over time.  More \ndetail on such methods is beyond the scope of this text. \nAnother ULAE allocation approach is to study how claim adjusters spend their time\u2014working on what \ntypes of claims, what types of claim activities, lines of business, etc.  This may not be an easy \nundertaking, but it does bring more confidence that the ULAE dollars are being allocated for ratemaking \npurposes according to how they are being spent in practice.  Before proceeding, the actuary should \nconsider whether the cost of the study is worth the additional accuracy gained as the effort can be very \ntime-consuming. \n6.23 U LAE  Ratio\n(1) (2) (3)\nCalendar \nYe ar\nPaid Loss \nand ALAE Paid ULAE\nULAE \nRatio\n2008 913,467$      144,026 $       15.8%\n2009 1,068,918$   154,170 $       14.4%\n2010 1,234,240$   185,968 $       15.1%\nTotal 3,216,625$   484,164 $       15.1%\n(4) ULAE Factor 1.151\n(3) = (2) / (1)\n(4) = 1.0 + (Tot3)", "type": "Document"}}
