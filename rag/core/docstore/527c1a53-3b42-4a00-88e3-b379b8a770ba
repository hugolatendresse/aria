When separate case \noutstanding for ALAE exists, actuaries will also use a reported ALAE development technique.  \nAnother frequently used approach is the development of the ratio of paid ALAE-to-paid claims \nonly. We use a sample insurer writing automobile property damage insurance (Auto Property \nDamage Insurer) to demonstrate four projection techniques for ALAE. We understand based on \nour discussions with the claims department management that Auto Property Damage Insurer \nmaintains separate case outstanding for ALAE.  \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheets 1 through 3, we present the ALAE development method for reported and paid \nALAE; in Exhibit I, Sheets 4 through 8, we use the development method applied to the ratio of \npaid ALAE-to-paid claims. We present our final projection of ultimate ALAE in Exhibit I, Sheets \n9 and 10. In this approach, we also review the ratio of paid ALAE-to-paid claims. However, we \nuse additive development factors instead of multiplicative factors to project ultimate ALAE. In \n\u201cLoss Reserving,\u201d Mr. Wiser notes: \u201cIf the ratios are very small at early maturities, the additive \napproach seems to be more stable.\u201d89 It is important to remember that all of the assumptions \nunderlying the development technique described in Chapter 7 are equally applicable to the \nfollowing example for ALAE. \n \nWe begin our example with the projection of reported and paid ALAE in Exhibit I, Sheets 1  \nand 2, respectively. We immediately notice an increasing volume of reported and paid ALAE for \naccident years 2006 through 2008. After a quick review of the age-to-age factors (looking down \nthe columns) for the reported ALAE, we also observe a changing pattern of development \nparticularly at 12-to-24 months and 24-to-36 months. The age-to-age factors are smaller for the", "type": "Document"}}
