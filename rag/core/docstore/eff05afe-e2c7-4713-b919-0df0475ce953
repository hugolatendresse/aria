In Exhibit III, we summarize ultimate claims and \nestimated ultimate severities for each of the four projections. All three of the projections based on \nthe adjusted paid claim triangle are similar to one another, in total and by accident year. The \nresults of the Berquist-Sherman adjustment are consistent with our expectations due to our \nconclusion of a decrease in the rate of claims settlement.  \n \nWhile the three projections based on adjusted paid claims are similar to one another, we do not \nconsider these methods to necessarily be independent since they are based on the same source \ndata. Ideally, the actuary would incorporate other techniques to verify the results of the Berquist-\nSherman adjusted paid claims methodology. \n \n \nMonitoring and Interim Techniques for Unpaid Claim Estimates \n \nWe begin Part 2 of this book by presenting Ronald Wiser\u2019s four-phase approach to estimating \nunpaid claims. His final phase is monitoring projections of the development of unpaid claims \nover subsequent calendar periods. He notes that deviations of actual development from projected \ndevelopment of claims or claim counts are one of the most useful diagnostic tools for evaluating \nthe accuracy of the unpaid claim estimate. \n \nMonitoring performance between detailed analyses of unpaid claims is important both for \ncommercial insurers and self-insurers. Many actuaries build models to capture the difference \n                                                 \n85 PCAS, 1977. \n350", "type": "Document"}}
