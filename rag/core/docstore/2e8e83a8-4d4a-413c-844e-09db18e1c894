In Bayesian analysis there is no \nspecific calculation of the Z parameter, but a distributional assumption must be made.  Bayesian analysis \nis based on the fundamental notion that the prior estimate is adjusted to reflect the new information.  The \nnew information is introduced into the prior estimate in a probabilistic manner, via Bayes Theorem.  This \ndiffers from least squares credibility where the new information is introduced into the prior estimate via \nthe credibility weighting.  Note that due to the greater complexities of its probabilistic nature, Bayesian \nanalysis is not used as commonly in practice as B\u00fchlmann credibility.   \nIt is interesting to note that B\u00fchlmann or least squares credibility is the weighted least squares line \nassociated with the Bayesian estimate.  In certain special mathematical situations, the Bayesian analysis \nestimate is equivalent to the least squares credibility estimate.   \nDESIRABLE\tQUALITIES\tOF\tA\tCOMPLEMENT\tOF\tCREDIBILITY\t\nAs discussed earlier, the basic formula for calculating the credibility-weighted actuarial estimate using \nclassical credibility is: 45 \n.Experience  Related x ) - (1   Experience   Observed x    Estimate ZZ \uf02b\uf03d   \nOnce the credibility of the observed data is determined, the next step is to select the related experience.  \nThis is commonly referred to as the \u201ccomplement of credibility.\u201d  According to ASOP 25: \nThe actuary should use care in selecting the related experience that is to be blended with \nthe subject experience.  Such related experience should have frequency, severity, or other \ndeterminable characteristics that may reasonably be expected to be similar to the subject \nexperience.  If the proposed related experience does not or cannot be adjusted to meet \nsuch criteria, it should not be used.  The actuary should apply credibility procedures that", "type": "Document"}}
