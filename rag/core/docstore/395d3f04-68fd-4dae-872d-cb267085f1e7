A couple of these techniques will be discussed here briefly, \nbut an in-depth review is outside the scope of this text. \nLifetime\tValue\tAnalysis\t\nStandard actuarial ratemaking techniques develop the cost-based indicated rate required to achieve the \ntargeted underwriting profit over a short period of time (i.e., one year) assuming all insureds will renew.  \nLifetime value analysis tries to improve upon this by examining the profitability of an insured over a \nlonger period of time taking into account that not all insureds will renew.  To do this, assumptions are \nmade regarding the propensity of the insured to renew and the expected profitability of the insured over \nthe time period being projected.   \nTables 13.16 and 13.17 show an example of a personal automobile lifetime value calculation for \nanalyzing the longer term profitability of a 22-year-old and a 70-year-old.  The first row of each table \nrepresents the first policy year for the 22-year-old and 70-year-old, respectively.  The subsequent rows of \neach table show subsequent policy years, as each individual ages.  The premium, losses, expense, and \npersistency (i.e., the probability the risk will not cancel) are given for each year.  Premium varies by year \nreflecting any expected rate and relativity changes; losses vary by year reflecting overall loss trends and \nchanges in expected costs as the insured ages; and expenses vary reflecting different costs for new and \nrenewal business.  Columns 2 through 4 are used to calculate the profit in Column 5.  Column 6 shows \nthe probability that the risk will renew that year, and Column 7 converts the renewal probability of each \nyear into a cumulative persistency.  The profit in Column 5 is reduced to reflect the cumulative", "type": "Document"}}
