It is generally biased though the magnitude and \ndirection of bias are unknown.  If the actuary can adjust the related experience to match the exposure to \nloss in the subject experience, the bias can be reduced.  In the example mentioned above, the actuary \nneeds to consider how the exposure to loss for condos differs from owned homes and adjust the \nexperience accordingly.  \nSince the complement does not contain the subject experience, this lack of dependence may make it a \nbetter choice than the first method described. \nThe data for this method is likely readily available and the calculations should be the same as those used \nto derive the base statistic.  Adjustments made to the related experience to correct for bias may be \ndifficult to explain.  If the groups are closely related, then the complement will have a logical relationship \nto the base statistic.   \nRate\tChange\tfrom\tthe\tLarger\tGroup\tApplied\tto\tPresent\tRates\t\nThe loss costs of a larger related group may be a biased complement of credibility.  This third approach \nmitigates this problem by using the rate change indicated for a larger group applied to the current loss cost \nof the subject experience, rather than using the larger group\u2019s loss costs directly.   \nThe complement (C) can be expressed as: \n.Cost  Loss  AverageCurrent    GroupLarger  \nCost  Loss  Indicated  GroupLarger  ExperienceSubject  ofCost  LossCurrent \uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0b4\uf03dC  \nAs way of example, assume the following: \n\uf0b7 Current loss cost of subject experience is $200. \n\uf0b7 Indicated loss cost of larger group is $330. \n\uf0b7 Current average loss cost of larger group is $300. \nThen the complement of credibility, to be blended with the subject experience loss cost, is calculated as \nfollows: \n$220.$300\n$330$200 \uf03d\uf0b4\uf03dC  \nEvaluation\t\nEven when the overall loss costs for the subject experience and the larger group are different, this", "type": "Document"}}
