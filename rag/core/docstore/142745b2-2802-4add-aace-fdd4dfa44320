This contrasts \nwith calendar year in which written premium and cancellation premium can apply to two different \ncalendar years depending on when the cancellation occurs. \nEarned premium is the amount of the premium the insurance company has already earned in relation to \nhow much of the policy period has already expired.  Stated another way, the earned premium is the \npremium for the coverage that has already been provided.  This is important because earned premium \nrepresents the portion of the total premium that the insurance company is entitled to retain should the \npolicy be canceled.12    \nTo better understand the difference between calendar and policy year earned premium, first reconsider the \ncalendar year picture: \n \nFor Policy C in our example, 75% of the policy is earned in 2011 and 25% of the policy is earned in \n2012; thus, Policy C contributes $225 (= 75% x $300) of earned premium to Calendar Year 2011 and $75 \n                                                      \n12 Policies may contain a short rate table that entitles the company to retain an amount of premium that is greater \nthan the pro rata amount of premium for the time expired on the coverage period.  This is intended to reflect that \nsome of the premium is designated to cover expenses incurred at the onset of the policy or to reflect that the insured \nrisk may have much greater exposure to loss in part of the year (e.g., boat owners policies in many climates have the \ngreatest exposure to loss in the summer months).   \n5.8 Policy Year Written Premium a/o 12/31/12\nPolicy Premium PY 2010 PY 2011 PY 2012\nA1 0 / 0 1 / 1 0 0 9 / 3 0 / 1 12 0 0 . 0 0$    200.00 $    - $             - $", "type": "Document"}}
