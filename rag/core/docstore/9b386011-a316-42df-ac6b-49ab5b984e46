The final premium is calculated according to the audited \nexposure; any difference from the deposit premium can be charged or credited to the insured.   \nLarge\tDeductible\tPolicies\t\nIt is not uncommon for commercial entities to purchase insurance with deductible clauses similar to those \nfound in personal insurance.  For example, a commercial general liability policy may contain a $500 \ndeductible for property coverage.  The main purpose of small deductibles is for the insurer to keep \npremium low by avoiding expenses associated with the processing and investigation of small nuisance or \nfrivolous claims.  At some value, however, a deductible can be set high enough so that the insured is \nbearing significant risk.  For example, a large deductible workers compensation insurance policy may \nhave a deductible of $1 million per occurrence.  At that level, the expectation is that a significant \nproportion of claims will fall entirely within the deductible and thus the insured is bearing a significant \nportion of the risk.   \nWhen the deductible is set to a level where the insured is bearing significant risk, either from the \nexpectation of a large number of small claims or a small number of large claims, the following pricing \nconsiderations must be addressed in addition to those associated with small deductible pricing: \n\uf0b7 Claims handling:  It must be determined whether the insured or insurer will assume \nresponsibility for handling claims that fall entirely within the deductible.  Large deductible \npolicies will vary in their treatment of this issue; in some cases, the insured assumes \nresponsibility but in most cases, the insurer handles all claims.  If the insurer assumes \nresponsibility, the premium must be set to cover the cost for all claim handling expenses, even", "type": "Document"}}
