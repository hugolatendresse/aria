It is \nintended to be a single educational text to prepare actuarial candidates practicing around the \nworld for basic ratemaking.  A key concept in the text is the fundamental insurance equation, \nwhich balances the expected future income and outgo of an insurance operation.  Various \nchapters discuss the individual components of the equation (e.g., premium, loss, expense, \nprofit), and other chapters review how to assess whether the equation is in balance in the \naggregate and by customer segment.  The text focuses on quantitative analysis as well as \npractical considerations in the ratemaking process.  Finally, the text provides consistent \ndefinitions of terms and examples that underlie the ratemaking techniques discussed. \nWith significant contribution from: \nAlice Gannon, FCAS, MAAA; Serhat Guven, FCAS, MAAA;                             \nChristine Gennett, ACAS, MAAA; Jeff Kucera, FCAS, MAAA;                            \nBrett Nunes, ASA, MAAA; Dave Otto, FCAS, MAAA \nVERSION 5, MAY 2016 \n\u00a9 Copyright Casualty Actuarial Society, 2016", "type": "Document"}}
