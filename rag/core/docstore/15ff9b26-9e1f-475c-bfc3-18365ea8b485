The first record includes all the information at policy inception.  The second record negates \nthe portion of the original policy that is unearned at the time of the amendment (i.e., -0.50 exposure and   \n-$500 premium and deductible equal to $500).  The third record represents the information applicable to \nthe portion of the policy written with the new deductible (i.e., +0.50 exposure and +$600 premium and \ndeductible equal to $250).  \nTable 3.1 is an example policy database for the three policies described above. \n \nIn a more sophisticated data mart, information for Policy B would be aggregated to one record that shows \na \u201cnet\u201d exposure of 0.75 and \u201cnet\u201d written premium of $450.  Similarly, information for Policy C would \nbe aggregated to two records representing before and after the deductible change.  The first record would \nreflect the period of time with the $500 deductible and would have a \u201cnet\u201d exposure of 0.50 and \u201cnet\u201d \nwritten premium of $500.  The second record reflecting the period of time with the $250 deductible would \nbe identical to the third record in the original example.  The exposure is 0.50 and written premium is \n$600.  This type of transaction aggregation is required for statistical ratemaking analysis such as \ngeneralized linear models (discussed in more detail in Chapter 10). \nClaims\tDatabase\t\nMost companies maintain a separate database to capture all available information about the claims on a \nspecific policy.  In a claims database, each record generally represents a transaction tied to a specific \nclaim (e.g., a payment or a change in reserve).  The fields contain dates or other explanatory information \nwith respect to that claim.  Similar to the policy database, claims involving multiple coverages or causes \nof loss may be represented as separate records or via indicator fields.", "type": "Document"}}
