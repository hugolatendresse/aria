A more detailed discussion of \nthese methods is beyond the scope of this text. \nLoss\tTrend\tPeriods\t\nSelecting the loss trend(s) is only the first step of the trending process.  Similar to premium trends, the \nactuary must calculate the applicable loss trend period.  This is the period of time from the average loss \noccurrence date of each experience period (typically a calendar-accident year) to the average loss \noccurrence date for the period in which the rates will be in effect (a policy year or years).  This latter \nperiod is referred to as the forecast period.  The loss trend period depends on both the term of the policy \nand the expected duration for the new rates, typically chosen as one year.   \nFor example, assume the following: \n\uf0b7 The losses to be trended are from Accident Year 2011.  \n\uf0b7 The company writes annual policies. \n\uf0b7 The proposed effective date is January 1, 2015. \n\uf0b7 The length of time the rates are expected to be in effect is one year.   \n \nThe average loss occurrence date of Calendar-Accident Year 2011 (sometimes called the \u201ctrend from\u201d \ndate) is assumed to be July 1, 2011.  This is the midpoint of the calendar-accident year period for which \nthe annual policies provide coverage.  The average loss occurrence date for the policy year period in \nwhich rates will be in effect (sometimes called the \u201ctrend to\u201d date) is assumed to be December 31, 2015.  \nThis is because the policies will be written between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015, but the \ncoverage for these policies will extend until December 31, 2016.  The midpoint of that two-year time \nperiod is December 31, 2015.  Therefore, the loss trend period for Calendar-Accident Year 2011 is 4.5 \nyears.
