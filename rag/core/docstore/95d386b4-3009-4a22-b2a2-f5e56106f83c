The penalty decreases for loss sizes between the face amount \nand the coinsurance requirement.  There is no coinsurance penalty for losses larger than the coinsurance \nrequirement, but the insured suffers a penalty in that the payment does not cover the total loss. \nFor the coinsurance mechanism to work appropriately in the event of a loss, it is important that the value \nof the insured property can be established so that the coinsurance penalty can be accurately calculated. \nVarying\tRates\tBased\ton\tITV\tLevel\t\nA coinsurance penalty clause corrects for inequity caused by two homes being insured to different levels \nof ITV by adjusting the indemnity payment in the event of a loss.  Another way to achieve equity is to \ncalculate and use rates based on the level of ITV.  Returning to Tables 11.12 through 11.14, the indicated \nrate per $1,000 of insurance was the same for the two homes insured to full value (i.e., $5 per $1,000 of \ninsurance) and higher for the underinsured home (i.e., $6 per $1,000 of insurance).  If those indicated \nrates were used, the premium would have been equitable and no coinsurance penalty would have been \nnecessary.    \n$0\n$10\n$20\n$30\n$40\n$50\n$60\n$70\n$80\n$0\n$30\n$60\n$90\n$120\n$150\n$180\n$210\n$240\n$270\n$300\n$330\n$360\n$390\n$420\n$450\n$480\nPenalty ($000s)\nLoss Amount ($000s)\nCoinsurance\u00a0Penalty\ncV\nF\n 11.16 Coinsurance Penalty by Loss Amount", "type": "Document"}}
