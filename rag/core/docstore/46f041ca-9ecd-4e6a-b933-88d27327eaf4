Column 3 shows the premium of $400,000 split into the \npremium ranges.  Columns 4 through 7 show the applicable expense percentage for each type of expense.  \nIn the example, percentages for production and general expenses decrease for the larger premium ranges \nrecognizing that some of the expenses do not vary by premium.  Taxes and profit are assumed to be a \nconstant percentage of premium and no reduction is applicable.  Column 8 is the total expense and profit \npercentage by premium range, and Column 9 calculates the incremental change in the expense ratio for \neach premium range.  The applicable premium discount is calculated by dividing the percentage reduction \nby 1.0 minus the expense percentages for taxes and profit; the division reflects the fact that the when the \nfixed expenses are reduced, the variable items associated with those expenses (i.e., taxes and profit) are \nreduced, too.  The dollar discount is calculated by multiplying the premium in the range by the applicable \ndiscount percentage.   \nLoss\tConstants\t\nSmall workers compensation risks tend to have less favorable loss experience (as a percentage of \npremium) than large risks.  There are several theories for this phenomenon.  First, small companies \ngenerally have less sophisticated safety programs since they require a large amount of capital to \nimplement and maintain.  Second, small companies may also lack programs to help injured workers \nreturn to work.  Finally, the premium for small insureds are either unaffected or only slightly impacted by \nexperience rating, which results in lower rates for insureds with better than average loss experience and \nhigher rates for insureds with worse than average loss experience. 41  Thus, small insureds may have less \nincentive to prevent or control injuries than large insureds.", "type": "Document"}}
