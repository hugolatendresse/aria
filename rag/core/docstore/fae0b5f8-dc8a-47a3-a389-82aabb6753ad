UW  ExpensesUW LAE  LossesPremium \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d   \nThe preceding chapters have focused on techniques to calculate a set of indicated rates or indicated \nchanges to current rates to produce premium that is expected to cover all costs (i.e., the loss, loss \nadjustment expense, and underwriting expense) and achieve the targeted underwriting profit.  These \nindications represent the actuary\u2019s best cost-based estimate of rates to charge, given the available \ninformation.  Even when the company is very confident in the analysis, the company may elect to \nimplement rates and rating variable differentials other than those indicated.  \nThis chapter explores other considerations company management should make, along with the cost-based \nrate indications, to determine what rates to charge in practice.  More specifically, the following \nconsiderations are covered in this chapter:  \n\uf0b7 Regulatory constraints \n\uf0b7 Operational constraints \n\uf0b7 Marketing considerations \nREGULATORY\tCONSTRAINTS\t\nThe U.S. property/casualty insurance industry is highly regulated, and for the most part, the regulation is \nexecuted by the individual states both through state law and state regulatory agencies.  The amount of \nregulatory scrutiny can vary significantly by jurisdiction and by insurance product.  For example, the \namount of scrutiny tends to be high for personal automobile insurance since the majority of car owners \nhave to meet state-mandated financial responsibility requirements by purchasing this type of coverage.  \nSimilarly, workers compensation insurance is required for most U.S. employers to indemnify employees \ninjured on the job.  Because employee welfare is so important, workers compensation is a heavily \nregulated line of business in every state.
