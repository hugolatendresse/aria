The format of Exhibit I, Sheet 3 is identical to the \ndevelopment projection exhibits of many other chapters. \n \nMany actuaries also use a ratio approach when analyzing S&S. The first step in such an approach \nis to estimate the ultimate claims gross of S&S. In Exhibit I, Sheets 4 through 6, we project \nultimate claims for Auto Physical Damage Insurer based on reported and paid claims. We rely on \nthe five-year volume-weighted averages and select ultimate claims based on the average of the \nreported and paid claims projections (Exhibit I, Sheet 6). It is not surprising that the projections \nare very similar for this fast reporting and settling line of insurance. In Exhibit I, Sheet 7, we use \nthe development technique to analyze the ratio of received S&S to paid claims.79  \n \nOne advantage of the ratio approach is that the development factors tend not to be as highly \nleveraged as the development factors based on received S&S dollars. Another advantage is \nrelated to the selection of the ultimate S&S ratio(s) for the most recent year(s) in the experience \nperiod. In Exhibit I, Sheet 8, we use the development technique to project an initial estimate of \nthe S&S ratio to claim amount of 0.315 for accident year 2008. However, based on comparison to \nthe immediate preceding years, 0.315 seems low. This may be due to a change in procedures for \nrecording S&S or an unusually large claim. The average of the ultimate S&S ratios for the last \nfive years excluding 2008 is 0.347 and for the last three years excluding 2008 is 0.344. Thus, we \nselect an ultimate S&S ratio for 2008 of 0.345. We determine ultimate S&S based on the \nmultiplication of selected ultimate claims (from Exhibit I, Sheet 6) and the selected ultimate S&S \nratio (from Column (6)). \n \nThe results of all three projections are summarized in Exhibit I, Sheet 9.
