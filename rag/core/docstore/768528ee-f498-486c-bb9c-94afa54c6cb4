In such cases, the actuary must work with the data that is available \nand use actuarial judgment to overcome the data deficiencies.  For example, earned premium by territory \nis normally used for an analysis of auto territorial relativities.  If the company does not have earned \npremium by territory, the actuary may use in-force premium by territory to estimate the earned premium \nby territory. \nEXTERNAL\tDATA\t\nWhen pricing a new line of business, it may be necessary to use external data.  Even when pricing an \nexisting line of business, it is often helpful to supplement internal data with external data.  The most \ncommonly used sources of external information include data calls or statistical plan data, other aggregated \ninsurance industry data, competitors\u2019 rate filings, and third-party data unrelated to insurance.  As with \ninternal data, it is the actuary\u2019s responsibility to select the data with due consideration of reasonableness, \nappropriateness, comprehensiveness, and other factors from the Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 23, \nData Quality (Actuarial Standards Board of the American Academy of Actuaries) before using it.", "type": "Document"}}
