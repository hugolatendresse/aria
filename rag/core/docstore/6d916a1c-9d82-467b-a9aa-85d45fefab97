We can determine \nthe change in exposures based on the given premium information. While there was another \nreduction of approximately 30% in the exposures during 2007 (from 2006), the change in \nearned premiums between 2007 and 2008 was primarily due to the rate change and not due to \nchanges in exposure volume. The volume of reported claims at 12 months for accident years \n2007 and 2008 is consistent with the earned premium information. \n \nAt this point it is valuable for the actuary to analyze additional development triangles to look for \nanswers to some of the questions raised in this initial review of the claims data. \n \n \n67", "type": "Document"}}
