The Cape Cod \nmethod, which derives the expected claim ratio based on reported claims through the valuation \ndate, does not have this same weakness. In Exhibit III, Sheet 1, we see that the estimated claim \nratios in Column (8) respond to the changing environment in claims experience. The total all \nyears combined estimated claim ratio is 80.7% for this scenario; this compares to the 70% \nexpected claim ratio for the steady-state. \n \nIn the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported claim projection, there is no change in the estimated IBNR \nof $438,638 between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 since the expected claim ratio does not change. \nHowever, using the Cape Cod method, the estimated IBNR is $505,828 for Scenario 2. While this \nvalue is still short of the actual IBNR requirements of $601,984, the Cape Cod technique is more \nresponsive than the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method when the claim ratios are increasing. \n \n \nScenario 3 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Case Outstanding Strength \n \nWe present the calculations for Scenario 3 in the top section of Exhibit III, Sheets 2 and 4. In this \nexample, we see that the Cape Cod method results in an estimated IBNR that overstates the actual \nIBNR by an even greater amount than the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. In the \nprevious chapters, we discuss how the increase in case outstanding strength leads to an increase in \nthe cumulative claim development factors. Whereas the expected claims for Scenario 3 of the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method remain unchanged, the expected claims increase using the Cape \nCod method because the method reflects the higher level of reported claims.
