For simplicity, the example chosen \n(homeowners insurance) uses policies for which there is generally one exposure per policy.  These \nexample policies have annual terms; examples using semi-annual terms will be provided later in this \nchapter. \n \nThe aforementioned policies can be represented pictorially (see Figure 4.3).  The x-axis represents time, \nand the y-axis represents the percentage of the policy term that has expired.8  Each diagonal line \nrepresents a different policy.  At the onset of the policy, 0% of the policy term has expired; thus, that \npoint is located on the lower x-axis at the effective date.  At the conclusion of the policy, 100% of the \npolicy term has expired; thus, that point is located on the upper x-axis at the expiration date.  The line \nconnecting the effective and expiration points depicts the percentage of the policy term that has expired at \neach date. \n \nCalendar Year Aggregation and Accident Year Aggregation consider all exposures during the twelve-\nmonth calendar year without regard to the date of policy issuance; calendar and accident year exposures \nare generally the same9 and the text will use the term calendar year exposure.  At the end of the calendar \nyear, all exposures are fixed.  Since calendar year considers any transactions that occurred on or after the \nfirst day of the year, but on or before the last day of the year, calendar years are represented graphically as \nsquares in the following picture.    \n                                                      \n8 This assumes the policy is earned evenly throughout the policy period.  Some products (e.g., warranties) do not \nearn evenly. \n9 There are some limited cases when the calendar and accident year exposures will not be equivalent.  Policies that \nundergo audits will be discussed in the Premium Development section in the Premium Chapter. \n4.2 Policies\nPolicy\nEffective \nDate\nExpiration \nDate Exposure", "type": "Document"}}
