We notice age-to-age factors of less than 1.00 (also known as downward or \nnegative development) for reported claims only. This is not surprising to us since we know, based \non meetings with claims department management, that Auto Property Damage Insurer does not \nconsider salvage and subrogation (S&S) when setting case outstanding even though substantial \nrecoveries due to S&S are quite common for this line of business. \n \nIt is interesting at this time to compare the development patterns for ALAE and claims only. In \nthe following two tables we summarize the selected development patterns and the implied \nreporting and payment patterns for Auto Property Damage Insurer. \n \n R e p o r t e d  A L A E  R e p o r t e d  C l a i m s  O n l y  \nAge \n(Months) \n \nCDF \nImplied % \nReported \n \nCDF \nImplied % \nReported \n12 1.367 73.2% 1.101 90.8% \n24 1.169 85.5% 0.990 101.0% \n36 1.106 90.4% 0.989 101.1% \n48 1.066 93.8% 0.991 100.9% \n60 1.045 95.7% 0.993 100.7% \n72 1.008 99.2% 0.998 100.2% \n84 1.002 99.8% 0.999 100.1% \n96 1.000 100.0% 0.999 100.1% \n108   1.000 100.0% \n \n \n Paid ALAE Paid Claims Only \nAge \n(Months) \n \nCDF \nImplied % \nPaid \n \nCDF \nImplied % \nPaid \n12 2.138 46.8% 1.584 63.1% \n24 1.241 80.6% 1.029 97.2% \n36 1.155 86.6% 1.007 99.3% \n48 1.096 91.2% 1.004 99.6% \n60 1.058 94.5% 1.002 99.8% \n72 1.028 97.3% 1.001 99.9% \n84 1.013 98.7% 1.001 99.9% \n96 1.009 99.1% 1.001 99.9% \n108 1.007 99.3% 1.000 100.0% \n120 1.005 99.5%   \n132 1.005 99.5%   \n \nWe see that the ALAE reported and paid patterns lag the claims only patterns.
