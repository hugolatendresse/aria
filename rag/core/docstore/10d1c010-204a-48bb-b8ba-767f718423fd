After examining the frequency rates by accident year in Column (8), we \nrecognize a change in frequency between the earliest years in the experience period (2001 \nthrough 2004) and the most recent years (2006 through 2008).  \n \nIt is important for the actuary to speak to management at WC Self-Insurer to understand what \ncaused the dramatic change in frequency. Has there been a new cost containment program \nintroduced? Has there been a change in the definition of a claim? Has there been a change in \nthird-party administrators? Was there a change in the type of work performed by employees? We \nnote a large increase in both claims and payroll between 2005 and 2006. Was this the result of a \ncorporate acquisition? Any of these changes could have an effect on the frequency analysis. In \nour example, we assume that the change in frequency is due to a major acquisition, which \nresulted in the hiring of a new risk manager and the introduction of new safety and risk control \nprocedures. Thus, we select a 2008 frequency rate of 0.36%, which is reflective of the new and \nimproved environment with respect to claims at this organization. We derive the 2007 frequency \nrate of 0.37% by multiplying 0.36% by 1.025, which represents the adjustment for payroll \ninflation, and dividing by 0.99, which represents the adjustment for claims trend. \n \n \nProject Ultimate Severity \n \nWe now turn our attention to the analysis of severity. We begin with projecting paid severities \nand reported severities to an ultimate value (Exhibit III, Sheets 5 through 8). The development", "type": "Document"}}
