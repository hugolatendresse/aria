Bornhuetter and R.E. Ferguson47, a strictly fortuitous event \nsuch as an unusual large claims should not distort an insurer\u2019s estimate of IBNR. There are \ncircumstances, however, such as a large winter storm or other catastrophe, in which the insurer\u2019s \nIBNR should likely increase. \n \nFor an insurer entering a new line of business or a new territory, a sufficient volume of credible \nclaim development data may not be available. For some smaller insurers with limited portfolios, \nhistorical claim development data may not be sufficiently credible for the actuary to use the \ndevelopment technique. It should be noted that in such situations the development technique is \nstill often used. However, actuaries in these situations typically rely on benchmark patterns (such \nas from comparable lines of business or available industry data, as discussed earlier) to select \nclaim development factors, which they then apply to the insurer\u2019s latest valuation of claims. \n \nThe development technique is particularly suitable for high-frequency, low-severity lines with \nstable and relatively timely reporting of claims, especially where the claims are evenly spread \nthroughout the accident year (or policy year, report year, etc.) \u2013 that is, the volume of claims \nexperience is not changing significantly from one year to the next.  \n \nWhere there is not an even spread of claims throughout the year, the development technique can \ndistort the projected ultimate claims for an accident year. This is a result of the potential for a \nsignificant difference in the average claim maturity. To understand why this is the case, it is \nhelpful to think in terms of the individual claims making up the accident year. An accident year \nincludes individual claims that occur throughout the accident year. Some occur in the first month \nof the year, some in the sixth month, and some in the last month.
