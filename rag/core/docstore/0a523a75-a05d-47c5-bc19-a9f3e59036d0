First, an insurer may implement a cap on the amount of dollar \ncredit from the deductible; for example, the maximum dollar credit for moving from full coverage to a \n$250 deductible might be $200.  Second, companies may calculate a different set of credits for different \npolicies.  For example, a homeowners insurer may have different deductible credits for low-, medium-, \nand high-valued homes.  By segregating risks in this fashion, the chance of such reversals is minimized.  \nFinally, percentage deductibles address this issue since the amount of the deductible increases with the \namount of insurance.       \nThe examples did not address expenses, profit, etc.  These issues are especially important for large \ndeductible commercial policies and will be discussed in depth in Chapter 15. \nSIZE\tOF\tRISK\tFOR\tWORKERS\tCOMPENSATION\t\nMany commercial lines products have relatively simple rating algorithms.  Historically, workers \ncompensation rating algorithms did not include a rating variable accounting for the size of the insured \ncompany.  To account for expected differences in expense and loss levels for larger insureds, some \nworkers compensation insurers vary the expense component for large risks, incorporate premium \ndiscounts or loss constants, or all of these.   \nExpense\tComponent\t\nAs discussed in Chapter 7, commercial lines insurers typically use the All Variable Approach to \ndetermine the applicable expense provisions.  The basic assumption of that approach is that underwriting \nexpenses are a constant percentage of the premium charged.  Since some expenses are fixed or nearly \nfixed, they do not vary greatly by the size of the policy.  Consequently, policies with small average \npremium (i.e., small risks) will be undercharged and policies with large average premium (i.e., large \nrisks) will be overcharged.  Insurers may adjust for this in a few different ways.", "type": "Document"}}
