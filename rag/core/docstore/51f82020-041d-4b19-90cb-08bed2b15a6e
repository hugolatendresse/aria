We also add the projection based on the adjusted reported claims. As \nexpected, the projected ultimate claims based on the adjusted reported claim triangle are \nsignificantly less than the ultimate claims produced by the unadjusted data. To demonstrate the \nsignificant effect on the estimate of unpaid claims of this type of data adjustment, we calculate \nestimated IBNR and the total unpaid claim estimate in Exhibit I, Sheet 9 using all three projection \nmethods (i.e., unadjusted reported claims, unadjusted paid claims, and adjusted reported claims). \nWe summarize the totals in the following table. \n \n \nClaims Data Type \nEstimated IBNR \nTotal All Years ($ millions) \nTotal Unpaid Claim Estimate \nTotal All Years ($ millions) \nUnadjusted Reported 470 747 \nUnadjusted Paid 284 560 \nAdjusted Reported 154 431 \n \nBecause these three methods produce such dramatically different results, the actuary would likely \nseek alternative methods and additional information to determine which is, in fact, the most \nappropriate estimate of unpaid claims or whether another estimation method may be more \nappropriate. In many situations, actuaries summarize the results of numerous methodologies and \nselect a final estimate of unpaid claims that they believe is most appropriate based on the \ninsurer\u2019s particular circumstances.
