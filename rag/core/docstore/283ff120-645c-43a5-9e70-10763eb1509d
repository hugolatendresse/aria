A reduction occurs when the following three conditions apply: \n1. A non-zero loss has occurred (i.e., L > 0).  \n2. The face amount of insurance is less than the coinsurance requirement (i.e., F < cV). \n3. The loss is less than the coinsurance requirement (i.e., L < cV). \nThe amount of the penalty is given by the following: \n.\n if           ,0\n if     ,\n if     ,\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0a3\n\uf03c\uf03c\uf02d\n\uf0a3\uf02d\n\uf03d\nLcV\ncVLFIF\nFLIL\ne  \nTo illustrate these points, consider a home valued at $500,000 that is only insured for $300,000 despite a \ncoinsurance requirement of 80% (or $400,000 in this case).
