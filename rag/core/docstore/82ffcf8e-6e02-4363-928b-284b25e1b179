In our example, we present accident year data using annual valuations, and thus the ages \nin the columns are 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months. Different valuations can be \nused by the actuary (e.g., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, etc.). \n \n \nAlternative Format of Development Triangles \n \nThroughout this book, we present development triangles with the rows corresponding to the \nexperience period22 (e.g., accident year in the previous example) and the columns representing the \nmaturity ages.23 This is by far the most common presentation of development triangles. Some \ninsurers, however, reverse this orientation and present accident years (or policy or underwriting \nyears) as the columns and the maturity ages as the rows. Prior to commencing the analysis of \nunpaid claims, it is important for the actuary to understand the way in which the insurer \naggregates the data and reports the data in the development triangle. \n \n \nDetailed Example of Claim Development Triangles \n \nUnderstanding the Data \n \nTo better understand how to create a claim development triangle, we turn our attention to the \nindividual claims detail that underlies the reported claim triangle shown in Table 3. In our \nexample, we demonstrate how to integrate the claims amounts shown in the claims listing below \ninto the cells of the various claim development triangles. (In the table below, we use the \nabbreviation case O/S to mean case outstanding.) \n \nTable 5 \u2013 Detailed Example \u2013 Claims Transaction Data \n   2 0 0 5  T r a n s a c t i o n s  2 0 0 6  T r a n s a c t i o n s  2 0 0 7  T r a n s a c t i o n s  2 0 0 8  T r a n s a c t i o n s  \n \nClaim \nID \n \nAccident \nDate \n \nReport \nDate \n \nTotal \nPayments \nEnding \nCase \nO/S \n \nTotal \nPayments", "type": "Document"}}
