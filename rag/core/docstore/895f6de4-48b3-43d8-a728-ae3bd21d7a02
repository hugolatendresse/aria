Consider the generic formula, where primary and excess losses are credibility weighted \nseparately: \n,010.1 eeeePPPP\nE\nE)Z.(AZE)Z(AZM \uf0b4\uf02d\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02d\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d  \nwhere \nM = Experience Modification Factor  \nAp = Actual Primary Losses \n Ae = Actual Excess Losses \n Ep = Expected Primary Losses \n Ee = Expected Excess Losses \n E = Ep + Ee \nZp = Primary Credibility \n Ze = Excess Credibility \n \nAlthough algebraically equivalent, the NCCI uses an alternative expression of this formula by substitution \nof some terms, which is shown below.   \n,01 eeP\nBE\nBEw).(AwAM \uf02b\n\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02d\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf03d  \nwhere \n B = Ballast Value, which is based on: Zp = E / (E +B) \nw = Weighting Value = Ze / Zp. \n \nThe primary and excess credibility factors are not expressed directly in the NCCI\u2019s formula above.  The \nprimary credibility factor is a function of the ballast value (B).  The excess credibility factor is a function \nof both the ballast value (B) and the weighting value for excess losses (w).  The ballast value and \nweighting value are obtained from a table based upon the policy\u2019s expected losses and both values \nincrease as expected losses increase.  Further detail on the derivation of the NCCI formula is beyond the \nscope of this text. \nThe experience period consists of the three most recent complete policy years.  The actual losses are the \nreported losses evaluated at 18 months, 30 months, and 42 months from the beginning of the most recent, \nsecond most recent and third most recent policy years, respectively.  The actual primary losses are capped \nat $5,000 per loss.", "type": "Document"}}
