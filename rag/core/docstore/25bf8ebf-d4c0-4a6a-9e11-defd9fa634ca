The determination of the claim \nlimit is a matter of significant actuarial judgment and is beyond the scope of this book. (See \nprevious discussion of determining a large claims threshold in Chapter 3.) \n \nPolicy deductibles can also cause a distorting effect on the analysis of average values. Again, the \nactuary must understand what is included and excluded from the data source, in terms of claims, \nrecoverables, and claim counts. Retentions can also distort severities. \n \nFor XYZ Insurer, closed claim counts exclude claims closed without any payment; similarly, \nreported claim counts exclude claims in which there are no case outstanding and no payments. \nPaid claims, for XYZ Insurer, include partial payments as well as payments on closed claims. \nThus, our average paid claim triangle will be a combination of payments on settled claims as well \nas payments on claims that are still open.   \n \nWe present the average reported claim triangle for XYZ Insurer in the following table. The \naverage reported claim triangle is frequently used to detect possible changes in case outstanding \nadequacy. It is not quite as valuable as the average case outstanding triangle since reported claims \ninclude both paid claims and unpaid case. As we discussed previously, changes in paid claims \nhave the potential to mask changes in case outstanding adequacy. However, for some insurers, \nopen claim counts are not available in triangular format and the average reported claim triangle \nmay be all that the actuary has available for diagnostic purposes. \n73", "type": "Document"}}
