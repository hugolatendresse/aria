An actuary pricing a 2011 occurrence policy \nhas to project the ultimate value of claims that occur in 2011 and may not even be reported until 2015.  In \ncontrast, an actuary pricing a 2011 claims-made policy only needs to project the ultimate cost of claims \nthat will be reported in that year.  For claims-made policies, there is a shorter period of time between \ncoverage trigger and settlement date.  Since short-term projections are more accurate than long-term ones, \nthe pricing risk is significantly reduced with the claims-made policy compared to an occurrence policy.  \nPrinciple\t2\t\nPrinciple 2 states \u201cIf there is a sudden, unpredictable change in the underlying trends, the claims-made \npolicy priced based on the prior trend will be closer to the correct price than an occurrence policy based \non the prior trend.\u201d54 \nThe following table restates the example assuming the actual loss cost trend by report year is 7% instead \nof 5%: \n  \n                                                      \n54 The example that supports this principle assumes constant trends by report year.  Certain scenarios involving \nvariable and offsetting trends by report year (e.g., trend overstated in one report year and understated in the \nfollowing year) may violate the principle. \n16.3 E xamp le\n01234\nClaims-\nmade Los s  \nCosts\nOccurrence \nLos s  Cos ts\n2010 200.00$     200.00 $     200.00 $     200.00 $     200.00 $     1,000.00$     2010 1,105.13$", "type": "Document"}}
