This protects the insurer \nagainst adverse selection, which can lead to unsatisfactory profits and loss in market share.  Effective \nclassification ratemaking may provide insurers with a competitive advantage and may help expand the \nprofile of risks the insurer is willing and able to write profitably. \nThis chapter begins with a review of the shortcomings of the one-way classification ratemaking \napproaches outlined in the previous chapter.  It then discusses the advancement of iteratively standardized \none-way approaches, such as the minimum bias procedures, which address some of the shortcomings of \none-way approaches.  Much of this chapter is dedicated to the use of multivariate approaches, including: \n\uf0b7 Circumstances that led to their adoption in classification ratemaking \n\uf0b7 The overall benefits of multivariate approaches \n\uf0b7 A basic explanation of the mathematical foundation of one particular multivariate method, \ngeneralized linear models (GLMs)  \n\uf0b7 A sample of GLM output \n\uf0b7 Examples of statistical diagnostics associated with GLMs \n \nFinally, this chapter concludes with a brief discussion of practical considerations and two developments \nthat have augmented multivariate analysis in the context of classification ratemaking:  data mining \ntechniques and the use of external data sources. \nA\tREVIEW\tOF\tTHE\tSHORTCOMINGS\tOF\tUNIVARIATE\tMETHODS\t\nThe previous chapter reviewed one-way, or univariate, approaches to classification ratemaking whereby \nthe loss experience (either pure premium or loss ratio) of the levels within each rating variable is \nexamined and compared in order to establish rate differentials to the base level.   \nThe shortcomings of univariate approaches were also discussed\u2014the primary one being that they do not", "type": "Document"}}
