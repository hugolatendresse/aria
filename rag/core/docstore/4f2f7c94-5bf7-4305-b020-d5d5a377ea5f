This \nparticular insurer maintains, separately, payment activity and case outstanding estimates for S&S. \nIn Exhibit I, Sheets 1 and 2, we use the development technique on reported and received S&S. \n(Some insurers use the term paid S&S instead of received S&S. It is important to recognize that \npaid S&S represents a payment made by a third-party to the insurer.) Since automobile physical \ndamage is typically a quick reporting line of business, it is not surprising that the S&S associated \nwith this coverage is also exhibiting a quick reporting pattern.  \n \nThe reported salvage and subrogation development factors in Exhibit I, Sheet 1, are very stable \nand indicate an age-to-age factor of approximately 1.068 at 12-to-24 months and slightly less than \n1.00 at 24-to-36 months. The development factors are also fairly stable for received S&S  \n(Exhibit I, Sheet 2). We select factors based on the latest five-year volume-weighted average \nfactors. In Exhibit I, Sheet 3, we project ultimate S&S based on the development technique \n329", "type": "Document"}}
