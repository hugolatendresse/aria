The fact that the subject experience has been split out of \nthe larger group suggests that the actuary believes the subject experience is different than the larger \ngroup.  If this is the case, then the larger group is likely a biased estimator of the subject experience.  The \nactuary may be able to make an adjustment to reduce this bias. \nThe complement can be constructed to include or exclude the subject experience.  If the complement \nexcludes the subject experience, then it is likely to be independent.  If the subject experience is included, \nthe key is to ensure it does not dominate the group.  For example, regional data, including the state, \nshould not be used as a complement if the state represents a large portion of the regional data.   \nThe loss cost data of the larger group is typically available and the loss cost is easy to compute.  As long \nas all the risks in the larger group have something in common, there is a logical connection between the \ncomplement and the subject experience. \nLoss\tCosts\tof\ta\tLarger\tRelated\tGroup\t\t\nInstead of using the loss cost of the larger group to which the subject experience belongs, the actuary may \nuse the loss costs of a separate but similar, large group.  For example, a homeowners insurer may use the \ncontents loss experience from the owners forms to supplement the contents experience for the condos \nform.", "type": "Document"}}
