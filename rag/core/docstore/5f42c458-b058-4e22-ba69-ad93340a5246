If the \nresulting proposed average premium matches the target average premium, then the placeholder base rate \nis the correct proposed base rate.  If not, the placeholder base rate requires adjustment, as described \nbelow. \n                                                      \n49 The seed base rate is an initial approximation of the proposed base rate.  It is merely a means to an end.  The \nproposed base rate will be derived from the seed base rate using algebra, as will be discussed.  In practice, the seed \nbase rate is often selected as the current base rate or the current base rate adjusted by the selected overall change in \naverage premium.", "type": "Document"}}
