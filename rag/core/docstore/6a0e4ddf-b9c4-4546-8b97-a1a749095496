This can include discussions with external \nauditors and, at times, reliance on their work regarding data verification. \n \n \nOrganizing the Data \n \nKey Dates \n \nHaving identified the types of data that actuaries use in determining unpaid claim estimates, we \nnow discuss how to organize the data. Key dates for the organization of the claim data include: \n \n\uf0be Policy effective dates \n\uf0be Accident date \n\uf0be Report date \n\uf0be Accounting date \n\uf0be Valuation date \n \nThe policy effective dates are the beginning and ending dates of the policy term (i.e., the period \nfor which the policy triggered by the claim was effective). Some systems only capture the policy \nyear (i.e., the year that the policy became effective). Reinsurers refer to the policy date as the \nunderwriting date (or year).   \n \nThe accident date is generally the date that the accident or event occurred that triggered the \npotential policy coverage. Some systems only capture the accident year (i.e., the year that the \ntriggering event occurred). This term can be ambiguous with regard to certain policies such as \nclaims-made policies. With claims-made policies, the accident date may be defined as the date \nthat the claim was reported as this is the date of the event that triggered coverage. Alternatively, \nsome may define the accident date for a claims-made policy as the date that an injury occurred \nwith the injury not covered by the policy unless the resulting claim was reported during the policy \nperiod.   \n \nThe report date is the date on which the claim was reported to the insurer and recorded in its \nclaims system. Some databases may split this into two dates: report date and record date. There is", "type": "Document"}}
