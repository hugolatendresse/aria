A more in-depth discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this \ntext. We recommend that the actuary seek additional information on this topic through the \nactuarial literature available on the CAS Web Site and the CAS Tail Factors Working Party. \n \nFor the U.S. Industry Auto example, we select a reported claim tail factor of 1.000; we also select \nan age-to-age factor of 1.000 for the 108-120 month interval. This means that we do not expect \nany further development on reported claims after 108 months. For paid claims, however, we \nexpect future development beyond 108 months; we select a 1.002 age-to-age factor for 108-120 \nmonths and a tail factor of 1.002 (based on the typical ratio of reported to paid claims at this age). \n \n \nStep 6 \u2013 Calculate Cumulative Claim Development Factors (CDF) 43 \n \nWe calculate cumulative claim development factors by successive multiplications beginning with \nthe tail factor and the oldest age-to-age factor. The cumulative claim development factor projects \nthe total growth over the remaining valuations. Cumulative claim development factors are also \nknown as age-to-ultimate factors and claim development factors to ultimate.  \n                                                 \n42 PCAS, 1978. \n \n43 As noted previously, we specifically choose to use the terminology claims instead of losses in this text. \nThus, we use CDF for claim development factor to ultimate. Many actuaries use the term losses and thus \nLDF to represent the loss development factor to ultimate. In South Africa, actuaries often use LDF to refer \nto the incremental loss development factor and UDF to refer to the cumulative loss development factor or \nloss development factor to ultimate. The important message for the actuary is that he or she must \nunderstand the terminology, including abbreviations, for any analysis. \n90", "type": "Document"}}
