We use numerous methodologies for \nthe same examples, not simply for the purpose of demonstration, but because actuaries should use \nmore than one method when analyzing unpaid claims. No single method can produce the best \nestimate in all situations. In their 1977 paper, Berquist and Sherman recommend that where \npossible, the actuary conducting an analysis of unpaid claims should use methods that incorporate \nthe following: \n \n\uf0be Projections of reported claims \n\uf0be Projections of paid claims \n\uf0be Projections of ultimate reported claim counts and severities \n\uf0be Estimates of the number and average amount of outstanding claims \n\uf0be Claim ratio estimates82 \n \nBerquist and Sherman further recommend that wherever possible the actuary should incorporate \nthe concepts of credibility, regression analysis, and data smoothing into the actuarial methods \nused. They state: \u201cThe methods applied should range from those which are highly stable (i.e., \nrepresentative of the average of experience over several years) to those which are highly \nresponsive to trends and to more recent experience.\u201d It is then the responsibility of the actuary to \nselect the most appropriate estimate of unpaid claims. In some situations, actuaries may \nincorporate the concept of credibility into the selection process; at other times actuarial judgment \nwill prevail. When incorporating regression analysis into a method, Berquist and Sherman \nrecommend using some measure of the goodness-of-fit to evaluate the appropriateness of that \nmethod\u2019s projections.  \n \nIn \u201cReinsurance,\u201d Patrik comments on the selection process of techniques for the analysis of \nunpaid claims: \n \nYou can see there are many possibilities, and no single right method.
