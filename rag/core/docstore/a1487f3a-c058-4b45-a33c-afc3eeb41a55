Benefit changes typically affect \npolicies prospectively; in such cases, the effect of the change will first appear in a new accident year row.  \nIf the change impacts all claims occurring on or after a certain date, then it is possible that there will be a \ndramatic change in the absolute amount of losses even though the development pattern is unaffected.  In \nthe rare case that the change affects all claims not yet settled regardless of the date the loss occurred, then \nit may result in a shift of the aggregate loss amounts on a diagonal, which will distort the link ratios.  If it \nis not possible to restate the losses, then any such distortions should be considered during the age-to-age \ndevelopment factor selection process.   \nThe chain ladder method is only one method for calculating loss development.  As mentioned earlier, the \nbasic assumption of the chain ladder method is that the historical emergence and payment patterns are \nindicative of patterns expected in the future.  In practice, these assumptions may not hold true.  Changes \nin claims handling methodology or philosophy or even dramatic changes in claims staffing may result in \nclaims being settled faster or slower than historical precedents, and this would violate the basic \nassumption of the chain ladder method.   \nIn practice, actuaries use a variety of methods to develop losses to ultimate.  Some methods, such as \nBornhuetter-Ferguson, incorporate a priori assumptions of the expected loss ratio in order to calculate \nultimate losses and consequently the outstanding reserve at a point in time.
