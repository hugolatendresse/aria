If the risks are not equally profitable, however, then \nthe distributional shift can affect the adequacy of the overall rates.   \nThis is a shortcoming of the standard actuarial techniques.  Price optimization techniques, as discussed in \nChapter 13, address this issue by taking into consideration how the rate change is expected to affect \ndemand (i.e., volume).  \nCALCULATING\tNEW\tRATES\tBASED\tON\tBUREAU\tOR\tCOMPETITOR\t\nRATES\t\nCompanies writing a brand new insurance product generally do not have the data necessary to project the \nindividual components of the fundamental insurance equation.  Consequently, these companies generally \nrely on information from their other similar products, similar products sold by competitors (if information \nis publicly available), or information from rating bureaus, and make adjustments accordingly.   \nIf the company has data from a related product or rating bureau, then the pricing actuary may be able to \ncalculate the rates directly using the techniques described under the pure premium approach.  The more \nlikely scenario is that the company must use the rates of a competitor or rating bureau as a guide.  This \nrequires a copy of the relevant rating manual or rating bureau filing.  Even if a competitor\u2019s rating manual \nis publicly available, the underwriting guidelines may not be.  To the extent that the competitor varies \npremium significantly based on underwriting criteria, the rating manual may not describe how these \ncriteria affect the premium.  In such cases, the company will need to use judgment to supplement the \ncompetitor information. \nIn addition to the competitor\u2019s rating manual, the company should try to obtain information regarding the \nrelative expense levels and profitability of the target competitor.
