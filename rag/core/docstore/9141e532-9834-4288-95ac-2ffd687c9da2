Similar to our projections using the \nclaim development and expected claims techniques, we demonstrate in Exhibit IV, that the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique will generate the correct IBNR requirement if there is no change \nin the product mix. \n \n \nU.S. Auto Changing Product Mix  \n \nIn the final example, we assume that the volume of commercial automobile insurance is \nincreasing at a greater rate than that of private passenger automobile insurance.
