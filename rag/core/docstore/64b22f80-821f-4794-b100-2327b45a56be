While actuaries frequently assume 5% of the most recent accident year ultimate claims \nas an approximation to estimate pure IBNR, the actuary should be able to support such an \napproximation based on the experience of the organization. To the extent possible, the actuary \nwould test this assumption by calculating the pure IBNR claims and determine the ratio to total \nunpaid claims. One method for testing this assumption is to first estimate the number of IBNR \nclaim counts (projected ultimate claim counts minus reported claim counts). The actuary can then \nmultiply the number of IBNR counts for each accident year by an ultimate severity value for each \naccident year to determine an estimate of ultimate claims associated with pure IBNR. Such an \nanalysis can be performed for each line of business, and the total ultimate claims associated with \npure IBNR can be compared to total ultimate claims for both IBNR and reported claim counts for \nthe latest accident year.  \n \n \n                                                 \n92 We do not address particular methods for allocating total IBNR between IBNYR and IBNER. However, \nactuaries may rely on report year analysis, frequency-severity techniques, or other approaches to estimate \nthe proportion of total IBNR that is pure IBNR. Actuaries often rely on judgment for this allocation when \nestimating unpaid ULAE. \n \n389", "type": "Document"}}
