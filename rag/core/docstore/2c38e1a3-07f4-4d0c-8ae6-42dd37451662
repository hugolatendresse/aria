If the analyst needs the average fixed expense per exposure \n(which is required for the pure premium approach discussed in Chapter 8) instead of a fixed expense ratio, \nthe fixed expense provision can be multiplied by the projected average premium (trending premium into \nthe projection period was discussed in Chapter 5). \nPremium.

(Of course, the actuary can select other than the historical ratios.)  Since the variable \nexpenses (e.g., commissions) vary directly with premium, the historical variable expense ratio will likely \nbe appropriate.  However, since the fixed expenses\u2014by definition\u2014do not vary with premium, the fixed \nexpense ratio will be distorted if the historical and projected premium levels are materially different.  \nThere are a few circumstances that can cause such a difference to exist.", "type": "Document"}}
