The estimated \ntrended tail severity is equal to the sum of trended claim payments divided by the sum of the \nincremental closed claim counts. \n \nThe importance of the selection of the tail severity (i.e., the average value for the oldest years) is \nsimilar to the selection of a tail factor for the development technique; tail factors and tail \nseverities require substantial judgment. Considerations as to the maturity age at which to combine \ndata for analysis of the tail factor depend on: \n \n\uf0be The age(s) at which the results become erratic \n\uf0be The influence on the total projections of selecting a particular age \n\uf0be The percentage of claims expected to be closed beyond the selected maturity age \n \nIn our example, we observe greater variability in the trended severities beginning at age 60. The \nselected disposal rate at 60 months is 0.791; in other words, we expect more than 20% of the \nclaim counts to remain open at this age. There are 227 incremental closed claim counts in our \ndata set at 60 months that can be compared with only 124 at age 72 months. It is quite clear that \nfor ages 72 months and older, the experience should be combined for the purpose of selecting an \nincremental tail severity. However, it is less obvious what the actuary should do at 60 months. In \nour example, we select an incremental trended severity of $140,802 at 60 months based on the \nexperience of 60-month data only. This is not very different from the estimated severity of \n$144,160 for ages 60 and older developed in Exhibit V, Sheet 9. We select a trended tail severity \nof $175,816 based on the combined experience of ages 72 and greater. The effect of selecting a \ntail severity based on the experience of 60 months and greater, would be a reduction of the unpaid \nclaim estimate of more than 10%. This demonstrates the importance of selecting the appropriate \npoint at which data should be combined for determining a tail severity. \n \n209", "type": "Document"}}
