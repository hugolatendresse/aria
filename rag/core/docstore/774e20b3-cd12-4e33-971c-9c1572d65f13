(This is outside the scope of this text.)  In addition, the \nconsiderations covered earlier in this chapter (regulatory and operational) still apply. \nIn summary, actuaries have always considered both expected loss costs and customer demand when \nsetting rates, although the customer demand aspect was often incorporated judgmentally.  Optimized \npricing more systematically combines knowledge of loss costs and customer demand to develop rates that \nmeet the particular volume and profitability objectives of the company, and represents an improvement \nover traditional techniques.   \nUnderwriting\tCycles\t\nWhen determining which rates to implement, it is important to understand that the insurance industry \nhistorically has cyclical results.  In other words, the overall profitability of the industry tends to oscillate \nsystematically.  The industry uses the terms \u201chard market\u201d and \u201csoft market\u201d to identify the peaks and \nvalleys of this cycle.  The hard market refers to periods of higher price levels and increased profitability.  \nNormally, \ncompanies \nrespond to this \nprofitability by \ntrying to expand \ntheir market \nshare.  To do \nthis, some \ncompanies \nbecome more \naggressive in \ntheir pricing \n(often deviating \nfrom actuarial \nindications), \nwhich puts \npressure on \nother companies \nto respond by \nreducing prices.  \nThis generally leads to a soft market, during which profits are lower.  In response to the low profits \ngenerated during a soft market, companies again begin to focus more on the actuarial indications and take \nappropriate rate increases.  Thus, competitive pressures ease and the cycle begins again.  The cycle is \ndemonstrated pictorially in Figure 13.19. \nWhen making pricing decisions, it is important that the actuary understands the existence of underwriting \ncycles and considers the current cycle stage of the industry.  By understanding this, the company can \nbetter respond to changes in the market conditions.", "type": "Document"}}
