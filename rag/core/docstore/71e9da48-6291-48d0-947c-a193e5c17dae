This method is similar to accident year except the \nlosses are aggregated according to when the claim is reported, as opposed to when the claim occurs.  The \naccident dates are maintained so the actuary can determine the lag in reporting, and the report year losses \nmay be subdivided based on the report lag.  By design, this type of aggregation results in no IBNR \n(incurred but not reported) claims, but a shortfall in case reserves (i.e., incurred but not enough reported, \nor IBNER) can exist.  For standard ratemaking, report year aggregation is generally limited to the pricing \nof claims-made policies.  Claims-made policies provide coverage based on the date the claim is reported, \nas opposed to the date the claim occurs.  Companies may choose to write claims-made policies in lines of \nbusiness for which there is often a significant lag between the date of the occurrence and the reporting of \nthe claim (e.g., medical malpractice).  Claims-made ratemaking is covered in more detail in Chapter 16. \nThe following example further illustrates quantifying reported losses under the different loss aggregation \nmethods.
