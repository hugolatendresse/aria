The preceding chapter provided techniques for estimating the projected \npremium.  Now attention is turned to the loss and loss adjustment expense components. \nAmounts paid or owed to claimants under the provisions of an insurance contract are known as losses.  \nThough some actuarial literature uses the terms losses and claims interchangeably, this text will use the \nterm claim to refer to the demand for compensation, and loss to refer to the amount of compensation.  A \nclaimant can be the insured or a third party seeking damages covered under the terms of the insurance \ncontract.  Amounts paid by the insurance company to investigate and settle claims are called loss \nadjustment expenses (LAE).  Losses and LAE usually represent the largest component of insurance costs \nand hence the largest portion of insurance premium.  It is easy to understand why quantifying expected \nfuture loss and LAE costs are of utmost importance to the pricing actuary. \nThis chapter discusses: \n\uf0b7 The different types of insurance losses \n\uf0b7 How loss data is aggregated for ratemaking analysis \n\uf0b7 Common metrics involving losses \n\uf0b7 Adjustments made to historical loss data to make it relevant for estimating future losses in the \ncontext of ratemaking.  This includes adjusting data for: \no extraordinary loss events \no changes in benefit levels \no changes in the loss estimates as immature claims become mature \no changes in loss cost levels over time \n\uf0b7 Treatment of loss adjustment expenses \n \nLOSS\tDEFINITIONS\t\nPaid losses are those losses that have been paid to claimants.  When a claim is reported to the insurance \ncompany and payment is expected to be made in the future, a case reserve for the expected amount is", "type": "Document"}}
