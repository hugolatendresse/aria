The following items affect the social acceptability of using a particular \nrisk characteristic as a rating variable:   \n\uf0b7 Affordability \n\uf0b7 Causality \n\uf0b7 Controllability \n\uf0b7 Privacy concerns  \n \nFirst, from a social perspective, it is desirable for insurance to be affordable for all risks.  This is \nespecially true when insurance is required by law (e.g., states require \u201cproof of financial responsibility\u201d \nfrom owners of vehicles and that is most easily achieved though personal automobile insurance) or \nrequired by a third party (e.g., lenders require homeowners insurance), or is merely desirable to facilitate \nongoing operation (e.g., stores purchase commercial general liability insurance).  In some cases, a \nparticular risk characteristic may identify a small group of insureds whose risk level is extremely high, \nand if used as a rating variable, the resulting premium may be unaffordable for that high-risk class.  To \nthe extent that this occurs, companies may wish to or be required by regulators to combine classes and \nintroduce subsidies.  For example, 16-year-old drivers are generally higher risk than 17-year-old drivers.  \nSome companies have chosen to use the same rates for 16- and 17-year-old drivers to minimize the \naffordability issues that arise when a family adds a 16-year-old to the auto policy.  The company may be \nwilling to accept the subsidy in recognition of the fact that the policy will be profitable in the long run as \nthe teenager ages.  Alternatively, companies have developed new insurance products that can support a \nlower rate for high-risk insureds by offering less coverage.  \nSecond, in addition to being correlated with expected losses, some risk characteristics directly impact the \namount of expected losses.  From a social perspective, it is preferable if rating variables are based on", "type": "Document"}}
