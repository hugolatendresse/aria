More information on this \ntype of analysis can be found in \u201cPersonal Automobile Premiums: An Asset Share Pricing Approach for \nProperty/Casualty Insurance\u201d (Feldblum 1996). \nOptimized\tPricing\t\nOriginally, multivariate statistical modeling techniques were used primarily to determine better estimates \nof loss costs for insureds with different characteristics.  More recently, these same techniques are being \napplied to develop renewal and conversion models (i.e., customer demand models).  These models are \nused to estimate the probability that an applicant will accept a quote (i.e., conversion model) or that an \nexisting customer will accept the renewal offer (i.e., retention model).   \nThe historical data used to develop these models includes a series of observations and a corresponding \nresponse for each observation.  For example, a conversion model dataset contains a series of new business \nquotes and whether each quote was accepted or rejected.  A retention model dataset contains a series of \nrenewal offers and whether each offer was accepted or rejected.  Each dataset should also include relevant \ninformation about each observation, including risk characteristics, amount of premium quoted, rate \nchange information (for retention models), and an indicator of the competitiveness of the premium.  The \nresulting models can help predict the change in close rate or retention rate in response to a proposed rate \nchange, given a set of observations and associated characteristics. \n   \n13.16 Four-Y ear Time H orizon for 22-Y ear-Old\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11)\nYe ar Age Prem Losses Expense Profit\nRenewal \nProb\nCumulative \nPersistency Adj Profit\nPV of Adj \nProfit\nPV of \nPremium Profit %", "type": "Document"}}
