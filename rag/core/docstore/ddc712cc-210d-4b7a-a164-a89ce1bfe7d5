As discussed with the shock losses, the number \nof years used for this procedure should balance stability and responsiveness.  For example, if the \nconcentration of exposures in the most hail-prone area of a state has increased drastically over the past 20 \nyears, then a catastrophe procedure based on 20 years of statewide data may understate the expected \ncatastrophe potential.  Once determined, the ratio can be used to adjust the non-catastrophe losses in \nconsideration of future expected catastrophe loss. \nAlternatively, the actuary can develop a pure premium (or loss ratio) specifically for the non-modeled \ncatastrophe exposure.  In the pure premium case, the actuary could examine the long-term ratio of cat \nlosses to exposure (or to some inflation-sensitive measure like amount of insurance years) and apply that \nratio to projected exposures (or projected amount of insurance years).  Appendix B provides an example \nof deriving a non-modeled catastrophe pure premium.  The loss ratio indication would be similar except \nthe denominator of the long-term ratio would be earned premium, which is inflation-sensitive (though \nperhaps not to the same degree as the catastrophe losses), and the premium would need to be brought to \ncurrent rate level. \nCatastrophe models are generally used to account for events that are extremely sporadic and generate high \nseverity claims, such as hurricanes and earthquakes.  Even thirty years of data may not capture the correct \nexpectation of the damage these events can inflict.  For these types of catastrophes, sophisticated \nstochastic models are designed by professionals from a variety of fields (e.g., insurance professionals, \nmeteorologists, engineers) to estimate the likelihood that events of varying magnitudes will occur and the", "type": "Document"}}
