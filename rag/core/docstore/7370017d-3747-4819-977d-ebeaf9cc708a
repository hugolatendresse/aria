Earned premium may be the most common type of exposure used in estimation \ntechniques for both insurers and reinsurers. Other types of exposures used by insurers may \ninclude: written premium, policies in force, policy limits by region (for the early estimation of \nunpaid claims related to a natural catastrophe), the number of vehicles insured (for personal \nautomobile insurance), and payroll (for workers compensation).  \n \nIt is often valuable for actuaries to adjust historical premiums to current rate levels (i.e., on-level \npremiums). There are two ways in which actuaries typically derive on-level premiums. The first \nmethod essentially requires a re-rating of historical exposures at current rates. This is a computer-\nintensive exercise and may not be feasible in all situations. A second method is to use a summary \nof rate level changes over the experience period and adjust the premiums in the aggregate for \nhistorical rate changes. There are many instances, however, when the actuary is unable to collect \nreliable information regarding rate changes and must use the premium data from the insurer on an \nunadjusted basis. \n \nSelf-insured organizations do not generally collect premiums in the same way that an insurance \ncompany does. As a result, actuaries working with self-insurers generally use other readily \nobservable and available exposure bases that they believe are closely related to the risk and thus \nthe potential for claims.  \n \nThe following table summarizes, by line of business, examples of the types of exposures that", "type": "Document"}}
