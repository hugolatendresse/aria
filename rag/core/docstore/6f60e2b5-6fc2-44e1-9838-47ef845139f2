We start by following the same approach as the previous two frequency-severity \ntechniques: project ultimate claim counts based on development projections of closed and \nreported claim counts. (See Exhibit V, Sheets 1 through 3.) Our data excludes CNP counts, which \nhelps to explain why we observe downward (i.e., negative) development in the age-to-age factors \nfor reported claim counts (Exhibit V, Sheet 2). For GL Insurer, we select development factors \nbased on the volume-weighted averages for the latest three years. We judgmentally select tail \nfactors based on the observed experience for the oldest maturities, including the ratio of closed-\nto-reported claim counts, and benchmark patterns for a similar portfolio of coverage. In Exhibit \nV, Sheet 3, we summarize the projection of ultimate closed and reported claim counts; for each \naccident year, we then select the ultimate number of claims, based on the average of the two \nprojections.  \n \n \nDevelop Disposal Rate Triangle and Select Disposal Rate by Maturity Age \n \nThe next step is to derive the disposal rate triangle. We define the disposal rate as the cumulative", "type": "Document"}}
