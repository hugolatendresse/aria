First, the insurance payment will not be \nsufficient to cover the full loss amount 20% of the time.  Thus, the insured will not be returned to the pre-\nloss condition.  Second, if the insurer assumes all homes are insured to full value and uses a rate of $5 per \n$1,000, then the premium will not be sufficient to cover the expected payments for a home that is \nunderinsured.  Therefore, the rates are not equitable.        \nIt is important to note that the inequity in the rates is caused by the fact that the homes are not insured to \nthe same level.  If all homes are underinsured by the same percentage amount, then the resulting premium \nmay not be adequate to cover all the losses, but the premium will be equitable.  Over time, the base rate \nwill adjust so that aggregate premium covers the aggregate losses at the actual level of ITV present in the \nbook of business.  \nA key point is that the inequity and adequacy issues only exist because partial losses are possible.  The \nfollowing table shows a comparison if all claims are total losses: \n11.14 Calculations for a $250,000 H ome Insured  for $200,000\n(1) (2) (3)\nLos s  \nDistribution\nve g e\nReported \nLos s  \n($000s) \nAverage \nPayment \n($000s)\n-$       < X <= 25$      10.0% 12.5 $           12.5 $             \n25$        < X <= 50$      10.0% 37.5 $           37.5 $             \n50$        < X <= 75$      10.0% 62.5 $           62.5 $             \n75$        < X <= 100$    10.0% 87.5 $           87.5 $             \n100$      < X <= 125$    10.0% 112.5 $         112.5 $           \n125$      < X <= 150$    10.0% 137.5 $         137.5 $           \n150$      < X <= 175$    10.0% 162.5 $         162.5 $           \n175$      < X <= 200$    10.0% 187.5 $         187.5 $           \n200$      <X <= 225$    10.0% 212.5 $         200.0 $           \n225$      < X <= 250$    10.0% 237.5 $         200.0 $           \n100.0% 125.0$         120.0 $           \n(4) Frequency 1%", "type": "Document"}}
