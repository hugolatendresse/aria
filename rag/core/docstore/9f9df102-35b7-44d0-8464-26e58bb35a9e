Any pattern in the residuals (i.e., the residuals are all \npositive or negative in a certain region) indicates the existence of geographic residual variation.   Once \nidentified, the spatially smoothed residuals can be used to adjust the geographic estimators to improve the \noverall predictive power of the model. \nClustering\t\nOnce the geographic estimators are calculated for each unit, the units can be grouped into territories.  \nWhen combining units, the goal is to minimize within group heterogeneity and maximize between group \nheterogeneity.  As with smoothing techniques, there are a variety of clustering techniques that can achieve \nthis.  The following are basic categories of clustering routines: \n\uf0b7 Quantile methods create clusters based on either equal numbers of observations (such as \ngeographic units) or equal weights (such as exposure). \n\uf0b7 Similarity methods create clusters based on how close the estimators are to one another.  The \ndefinition of closeness can be based on a few different statistics:   \no The average linkage similarity method creates boundaries based on the overall average \ndifference between the estimators from one cluster to the next.  This tends to join clusters \nwith smaller variances.   \no The centroid similarity method creates boundaries based on the overall average \ndifference in estimators squared.  This tends to be more responsive to outliers.   \no Ward\u2019s clustering method creates boundaries that lead to the smallest within cluster sum \nof squares difference.  This tends to produce clusters that have the same number of \nobservations. \nIt is important to note that these types of clustering routines do not naturally produce contiguous \ngroupings (i.e., groupings that only include geographic units that are adjacent to each other).
