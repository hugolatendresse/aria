Losses are amounts paid or owed to \nclaimants under the provisions of the insurance contract.  This chapter outlines the different types of \ninsurance losses, reviews how loss data is aggregated for ratemaking analysis, and defines common \nmetrics involving losses.  This chapter also describes the various adjustments to historical loss data to \nmake it relevant for estimating future losses.  These include adjustments for extraordinary events, changes \nin benefit levels, changes in loss estimates as claims mature, and changes in cost levels over time.  \nFinally, the chapter discusses the treatment of loss adjustment expenses in ratemaking. \n \nChapter 7 covers methods for projecting underwriting expenses and addresses how to incorporate the \ncost of reinsurance and an underwriting profit provision in the rates. \n \nChapter 8 demonstrates how to combine the various estimated components of the fundamental insurance \nequation (i.e., premium, loss, expense) to ascertain the appropriate overall rate level (or rate level change) \nfor the future policy period.  The two overall rate level methods discussed are the pure premium and loss \nratio methods.  The methods are mathematically equivalent, but each offers advantages and disadvantages \nin certain circumstances. \n \nChapter 9 covers rate adequacy at the individual risk (or risk segment) level.  The chapter discusses the \nconcept of risk segmentation via rating variables and outlines criteria to consider when using a certain risk \ncharacteristic as a rating variable.  The chapter also reviews the application of univariate methods to \nhistorical data to calculate rate differentials (or changes to existing rate differentials) for each rating \nvariable.  This process is known as classification ratemaking. \n \nChapter 10 is an extension of Chapter 9 that specifically addresses multivariate classification ratemaking", "type": "Document"}}
