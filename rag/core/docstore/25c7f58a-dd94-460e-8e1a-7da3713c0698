This can occur when companies elect not to \napply certain aspects of the variable expenses to the flat fee.  For example, some companies do not make \nthe flat fee subject to agent commissions. \nIf the premium-based expense projection method is used (as discussed in Chapter 7), a fixed expense ratio \nis calculated rather than a fixed expense dollar amount.  The ratio can be converted to a dollar amount by \nmultiplying it by the projected average premium per exposure, as shown in the following table. \n \nIn addition to fixed expense fees, some rating algorithms have other additive premium components.  For \nexample, in the homeowners line of business, many endorsements that add or extend coverage are priced \nseparately and added to the variable premium of the standard policy.  The same adjustment as described \nabove for fixed expense fees applies to other additive premium as well. \nDerivation\tof\tBase\tRate:\t\tNo\tRate\tDifferential\tChanges\t\nOnce the actuary selects the proposed average premium (or proposed change in average premium), \nproposed rate differentials, and proposed fixed expense fees and other additive premium, the remaining \ntask is to determine the proposed base rate.  Essentially, the base rate is derived such that proposed \naverage premium (or change in average premium) is expected to be achieved.  Regardless of whether the \npure premium method is used to calculate a target average premium, or the loss ratio method is used to \ncalculate a target change in average premium, the goal is the same:  to derive a base rate that achieves the \ntarget. \nFirst consider the simple scenario when there is only variable premium and rate differentials are not \nchanging.  In this case, the proposed base rate is equal to the current base rate times the ratio of the \nproposed average premium to current average premium:", "type": "Document"}}
