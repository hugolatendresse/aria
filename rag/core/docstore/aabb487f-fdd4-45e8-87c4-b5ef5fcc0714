If loss levels are \ndramatically different than expected, it may be prudent to examine a similar triangle of claim counts to \nsee if a significantly larger or smaller than usual number of claims was reported for a particular accident \nyear.  Alternatively, inconsistent patterns in the losses at the first development period may be expected for \nsmall portfolios or long-tailed lines of business.   \nThe development pattern is then analyzed by taking the ratio of losses held at successive maturities.  This \nratio is referred to as the link ratio or the age-to-age development factor.
