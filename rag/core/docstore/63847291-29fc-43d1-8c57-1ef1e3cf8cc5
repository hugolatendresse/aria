Berquist and Sherman present two alternatives for the actuary in addressing such \nsituations: \n \n\uf0be Treat problem areas through data selection and rearrangement \n\uf0be Treat problem areas through data adjustment \n \n \nReacting to a Changing Environment through Data Selection and Rearrangement \n \nBerquist and Sherman recommend that, wherever possible, the actuary should use data that is \nrelatively unaffected by changes in the insurer\u2019s claims and underwriting procedures and \noperations. For example, if the insurer has experienced a change in its approach to the \nestablishment of opening case outstanding, then the actuary may place greater reliance on \nmethods using paid claims that will be unaffected by the changes in case outstanding. Berquist \nand Sherman cite the following examples for selecting alternative data to respond to potential \nproblems related to a changing environment: \n \n\uf0be Using earned exposures instead of the number of claims when claim count data is of \nquestionable accuracy or if there has been a major change in the definition of a claim \ncount. \n \n\uf0be Substituting policy year data for accident year data when there has been a significant \nchange in policy limits or deductibles between successive policy years. \n \n\uf0be Substituting report year data for accident year data when there has been a dramatic", "type": "Document"}}
