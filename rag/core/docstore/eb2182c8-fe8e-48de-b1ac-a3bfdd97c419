If physicians with claims-made policies \nretire, they need protection against claims that are reported after the expiration of the last claims-made \npolicy.  This protection is given by a tail policy that covers losses occurring during the period for which \nclaims-made coverage was in force and that are reported after the insured\u2019s last claims-made policy \nexpires. \nSUMMARY\t\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, professional liability insurers had poor results due to unanticipated inflation and \nincreasing claim frequencies.  Because of the long-tailed nature of the product, it took a significant \namount of time for insurers to realize and react to the poor results.  Insurers introduced claims-made \ncoverage to minimize the likelihood of the same thing happening in the future.   \nClaims-made policies differ from occurrence policies in that the coverage trigger is the report date as \nopposed to the accident date.  Claims-made policies are able to be priced more accurately because of the \nshorter forecast period.  \nAs there are different coverage triggers, it is important to carefully consider the interplay of claims-made \nand occurrence policies when an insured switches from one to the other.  Failure to do this can result in \noverlapping coverage or coverage gaps. \n  \n16.10 Sw itch from Claims-M ad e to Occurrence Policy w ith Tail Cov erage\n01234\n2010 L(2010,0) L(2010,1) L(2010,2) L(2010,3) L(2010,4)\n2011 L(2011,0) L(2011,1) L(2011,2) L(2011,3) L(2011,4)\n2012 L(2012,0) L(2012,1) L(2012,2) L(2012,3) L(2012,4)\n2013 L(2013,0) L(2013,1) L(2013,2) L(2013,3) L(2013,4)\n2014 L(2014,0) L(2014,1) L(2014,2) L(2014,3) L(2014,4)\n2015 L(2015,0) L(2015,1) L(2015,2) L(2015,3) L(2015,4)\nClaims -made = enclos ed by dotted rectangle\nTail Coverage = enclosed by dotted triangle\nOccurrence Policy Coverage = shaded\nReport Year Lag", "type": "Document"}}
