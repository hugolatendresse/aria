Remember the original formulae for the reported and paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson \nmethod: \n \nUltimate Claims = Actual Reported Claims + Expected Unreported Claims \n \nUltimate Claims = Actual Paid Claims + Expected Unpaid Claims \n \nWhile projected ultimate claims are increasing between Scenarios 1 and 2, the increases are due \nto higher values of actual reported and paid claims and not higher estimates of the expected \nunreported and unpaid claims. Since the expected claims estimate does not change in this \nexample, the expected unreported and unpaid claims do not change in Scenario 2 from the steady-\nstate values of Scenario 1.  \n \nFor the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique, the estimated IBNR is identical between the \nsteady-state environment and the environment with increasing claim ratios. Without a deliberate \nchange in the expected claim ratio, this method will not respond to a situation with increasing \nclaim ratios. The paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson performs even worse than the reported Bornhuetter-\nFerguson technique for Scenario 2. The estimate of expected unpaid claims is understated to an \neven greater degree than the expected unreported claims. This is due to the longer-term nature of \nthe payment pattern than the reporting pattern, which implies that the percentage unpaid cannot \nbe less than the percentage unreported at any age. (See Table 5 of Chapter 7, which summarizes \nthe reporting and payment patterns.) \n \n \nScenario 3 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Case Outstanding Strength \n \nWe present the calculations for Scenario 3 in the top section of Exhibit III, Sheet 2.
