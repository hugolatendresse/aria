The exposure measure used \nfor ratemaking purposes varies considerably by line of business.  For example, one house insured for one \nyear represents one exposure for homeowners insurance.  Annual payroll in hundreds of dollars represents \nthe typical exposure unit for U.S. workers compensation insurance.  There are four different ways that \ninsurers measure exposures:  written, earned, unearned, and in-force exposures.   \n\uf0b7 Written exposures are the total exposures arising from policies issued (i.e., underwritten or \nwritten) during a specified period of time, such as a calendar year or quarter.   \n\uf0b7 Earned exposures represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has already \nbeen provided as of a certain point in time.   \n\uf0b7 Unearned exposures represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has not \nyet been provided as of that point in time.   \n\uf0b7 In-force exposures are the number of insured units that are exposed to loss at a given point in \ntime.   \nChapter 4 includes an example demonstrating the different exposure measures and how they are \naggregated for ratemaking analysis.  \nPremium\t\nPremium is the amount the insured pays for insurance coverage.  The term can also be used to describe \nthe aggregate amount a group of insureds pays over a period of time.  Like exposures, there are written, \nearned, unearned, and in-force premium definitions.  \n\uf0b7 Written premium is the total premium associated with policies that were issued during a \nspecified period.   \n\uf0b7 Earned premium represents the portion of the written premium for which coverage has already \nbeen provided as of a certain point in time.  \n\uf0b7 Unearned premium is the portion of the written premium for which coverage has yet to be \nprovided as of a certain point in time.   \n\uf0b7 In-force premium is the full-term premium for policies that are in effect at a given point in time.", "type": "Document"}}
