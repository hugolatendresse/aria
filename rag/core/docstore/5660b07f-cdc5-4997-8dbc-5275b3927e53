It is generally accepted that the number of miles \ndriven is a risk differentiator for personal auto insurance.  However, many car owners cannot accurately \nestimate how many miles their car will be driven in the upcoming policy period, and even if they can, the \ninsurance companies may not currently have a cost-effective way to verify the accuracy of the amount \nestimated by the insured.  Since some companies feel the insureds may not supply sufficiently accurate \ninformation, they have chosen not to use annual miles driven as a rating variable.  Note, as technology \nevolves and on-board diagnostic devices become standard equipment in cars, the verifiability of this \nrating variable and how it is used in rating may be substantially different.", "type": "Document"}}
