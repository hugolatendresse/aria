This figure should be compared to the cost of making the change to help determine the \nappropriate course of action.   \nThe standard ratemaking analysis used to develop the indicated rate differentials generally does not \naccount for costs necessary to implement systems changes.  When such costs are considered, the indicated \nrates may be different.  There may also be other costs associated with this change (e.g., changes in \nstaffing for the underwriting department to handle the increased number of Class A insureds).  This is a \ncrude example of a cost-benefit analysis and is based solely on tangible benefits (e.g., profit) and costs \n(e.g., system costs).  Some projects may require significantly more complex calculations and may include \nintangible benefits (e.g., goodwill).  The amount of rigor necessary for any cost-benefit analysis should \nvary depending on the relative costs, benefits, and uncertainty associated with the project.   \nMARKETING\tCONSIDERATIONS\t\nPrior to this chapter, the focus has been on using traditional actuarial techniques to determine the \npremium at which a company is able to cover costs and earn the target underwriting profit without any \nregard to the company\u2019s ability to sell the product.  When assuming the number of policies is fixed, the \nrelationship between price and profit can be illustrated as follows: \n13.3 Calculation of Profit (After Rate Change and  Distrib utional Shift)\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\n$%\nA6 2 , 5 0 0        56,250,000$        900 $            950 $            3,125,000 $     5.3%\nB1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0   1,000,000,000$   1,000 $         1,055 $         55,000,000 $   5.2%\nTotal 1,062,500   1,056,250,000$   994 $            1,049$         5.2% 58,125,000$   5.2%\n(3) = (2) / (1)\n(6) = [(4) - (3)] x (1)", "type": "Document"}}
