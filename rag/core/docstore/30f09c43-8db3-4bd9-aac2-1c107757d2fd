This usually requires working with other professionals, such as lawyers or \nregulatory compliance experts, in determining what is acceptable and what is not. \nTYPICAL\tRATING\t(OR\tUNDERWRITING)\tVARIABLES\t\nThe following are a few examples of rating variables by line of business: \n \nNote that some risk characteristics may be used as both rating variables and underwriting variables. \nDETERMINATION\tOF\tINDICATED\tRATE\tDIFFERENTIALS\t\nIn addition to determining the rating variables and the levels within, the actuary must also identify the \namount of rate variation among the levels of each rating variable.  As discussed in Chapter 2, a rating \nvariable typically has two or more levels with one level designated as the base level.  The rate for all non-\nbase levels is expressed relative to the base level, as prescribed in the rating algorithm.   \nThere are many different approaches to determine differentials for a given rating variable.  The remainder \nof this chapter outlines traditional univariate methods that use the historical experience for each level of a \nrating variable in isolation to determine the differentials.  Each of the approaches described assume that \nthe rating algorithm is multiplicative, so differentials are referred to as relativities.  Differentials could \nalso be derived in an additive/subtractive fashion, though that is not addressed in this chapter\u2019s examples.  \nThe following approaches are discussed: \n\uf0b7 Pure Premium \n\uf0b7 Loss Ratio \n\uf0b7 Adjusted Pure Premium \n \nThe output of these approaches is a set of indicated rate relativities.  If the relativities are changed for \nsome or all of the levels of the rating variables, this can result in more or less premium being collected", "type": "Document"}}
