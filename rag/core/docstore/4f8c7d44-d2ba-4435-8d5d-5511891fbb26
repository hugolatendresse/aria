A third method, Bayesian analysis, introduces related \nexperience into the actuarial estimate in a probabilistic measure.  In other words, the method does not \nexplicitly calculate a measure of credibility. \n \nThese three methods are covered extensively in other actuarial texts; this chapter is meant to provide an \noverview. \nClassical\tCredibility\tApproach\t\nThe classical credibility approach, commonly called limited fluctuation credibility, is the most frequently \nused method in insurance ratemaking.  The goal of classical credibility is to limit the effect that random \nfluctuations in the observations have on the risk estimate.   \nIn this approach, a value of credibility (Z) is calculated and used to assign weights to the observed \nexperience (also known as subject experience or base statistic) and to some related experience in the \nfollowing linear expression: \n.Experience Related x  Z)- (1.0   Experience Observed x  Z  Estimate \uf02b\uf03d  \nLet Y represent the total number of claims, and S represent the total amount of losses.  The actuary first \ndetermines the expected number of claims, (E(Y), required for the observed experience to be considered \nfully credible (Z=1.00). \nThe observed experience is considered fully credible when the probability (p) is high that the observed \nexperience will not differ significantly from the expected experience by more than some arbitrary amount \n(k).
