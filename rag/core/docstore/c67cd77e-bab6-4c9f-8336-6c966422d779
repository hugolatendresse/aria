In the simple \nexample, the overall rate level analysis indicates a need to increase the average rate from $235 to $250, \nbut the company may choose not to do this.  Chapter 13 addressed reasons a company may implement \nrates different from those indicated.  If the company decides that $235 is the most that can be charged in \nthe short run, then the company is, in effect, forced to accept the resulting target underwriting profit \nprovision of -0.1% ( = ($235 - $180 - $20 \u2013 (15%  x $235) ) / $235 ) until rates can be increased.   \nSince achieving the target underwriting profit is important, most companies choose to change the current \nrates (i.e., implement a rate change) to achieve or at least get closer to the desired equilibrium.  The next \nsection covers the process that the actuary may use to revise the rates of an existing product to the desired \nlevel.  Calculating rates for a new product will be covered later in the chapter. \nCALCULATING\tNEW\tRATES\tFOR\tAN\tEXISTING\tPRODUCT\t\nIn order to calculate a final set of rates for an existing product, the company must: \n\uf0b7 Select an overall average premium target for the future policy period \n\uf0b7 Finalize the structure of the rating algorithm \n\uf0b7 Select the final rate differentials for each of the rating variables \n\uf0b7 Calculate proposed fixed expense fees and other dollar additives, if applicable \n\uf0b7 Derive the base rate necessary to achieve the overall average premium target", "type": "Document"}}
