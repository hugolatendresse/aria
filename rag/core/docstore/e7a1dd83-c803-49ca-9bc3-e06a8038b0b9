Depending on \nthe nature of the analysis, premium may be aggregated on a calendar year or policy year basis.  \nFurthermore, the actuary may examine in-force premium, written premium, earned premium, unearned \npremium, or all of them. \nWhen the actuary performs a loss ratio analysis, the actuary must project the premium that is expected \nduring the time the proposed rates will be in effect.  If the historical premium is used as a starting point \nfor the projection, the actuary must adjust the historical premium for any rate changes, premium \ndevelopment, exposure trend (when applicable), and distributional shifts that occurred during or after the \nhistorical period.  Failure to make these adjustments can seriously distort the loss ratio ratemaking \nanalysis.   \nAppendices A-D provide realistic examples of ratemaking analysis, including the premium adjustments, \nthat are intended to reinforce the concepts covered in this chapter. \n\t\n \t\n5.29 Tw o-Step  Trend ing\n(1) Calendar Year 2011 Earned Premium at Current Rate Level 1,440,788 $       \n(2) Calendar Year 2011 Earned Exposures 1,947\n(3) Calendar Year 2011 Average Earned Premium at Current Rate Level 740.00$            \n(4) 4th Quarter of 2011 Average Written Premium at Current Rate Level 753.00$            \n(5) Step 1 (Current) Trend Factor 1.0176\n(6) Selected Projected Premium Trend -1.0%\n(7) Projected Trend Period 1.6250\n(8) Step 2 (Projected) Trend Factor 0.9838\n(9) Total Premium Trend Factor 1.0011\n(10) Projected Premium at Current Rate Level 1,442,373 $       \n(3) = (1) / (2)\n(5) = (4) / (3)\n(8) = (1.0 + (6)) ^ (7)\n(9) = (5) x (8)\n(10) = (1) x (9)", "type": "Document"}}
