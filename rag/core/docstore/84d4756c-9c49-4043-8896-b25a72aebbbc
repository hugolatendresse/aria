(CY in \nthe diagram below refers to calendar year.) \n \nTable 4 \u2013 Diagonals of the Reported Claim Triangle Example \n \nAge (months)\nAcc Year 12 24 36 48\n2005  CY 2005\nCY 2006\nCY 2007\nCY 2008\n2006  CY 2006\nCY 2007\nCY 2008\n2007  CY 2007\nCY 2008\n2008  CY 2008\n \n \nThe first diagonal, which starts in the upper left corner of the triangle, is at the December 31, \n2005 valuation date and represents accident year 2005 at 12 months of maturity. Again, the \nstandard nomenclature is to count from the beginning of the accident year to the valuation date. \nThus accident year 2005, which begins on January 1, 2005, is 12 months old at December 31, \n2005.  \n \nThe second diagonal in the triangle is at the December 31, 2006 valuation date. At December 31, \n2006, accident year 2005 is 24 months old and accident year 2006 is 12 months old. To determine \nthese ages, we again count the number of months from the beginning of each accident year (i.e., \nJanuary 1, 2005 and January 1, 2006) to the valuation date of December 31, 2006. The third \ndiagonal continues in a similar manner. \n \nConcluding our example, the last diagonal of the triangle, at a valuation date of December 31, \n2008, represent claims for accident year: \n \n\uf0be 2005 as of 48 months (counting from the start of the accident year, January 1, 2005, to the \nvaluation date of December 31, 2008)", "type": "Document"}}
