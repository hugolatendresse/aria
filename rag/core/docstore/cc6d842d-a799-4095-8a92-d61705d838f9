If the homeowners \ncoverage is secondary to the PAF, the jewelry, watches, and furs losses from the homeowners policy will \nbe further reduced as they are now covered by the PAF.  As there is no way to know how many insureds \nwill purchase the PAF and the amount of PAF coverage they will purchase, it is very difficult to \naccurately quantify the indirect effect.     \nWorkers compensation benefits are governed by statutes and changes in these statutes can lead to direct \nand/or indirect effects on losses.  For example, statutes dictate the maximum/minimum benefits, the \nmaximum duration of benefit, the types of injuries or diseases covered, treatments that are allowed, the \nadministrative procedures to be followed, etc.  Consider the case where the workers compensation wage \nreplacement rate increases from 60% to 65% of pre-injury wages.  If this is the only change, there is a \ndirect effect as all workers will have their wages replaced at a higher rate; the direct effect on wage \nreplacement losses is easily quantified as +8.3% ( = 65% / 60% - 1.0).  There may also be an indirect \nbenefit as workers may be more inclined to file claims and claimants may have less incentive to return to \nwork in a timely manner.  This is difficult to quantify accurately and may require the actuary\u2019s \nprofessional judgment.  \nConsider another example where the workers compensation maximum indemnity benefit for a particular \nstate is changing.  The assumptions include: \n\uf0b7 The compensation rate is 66.7% of the worker\u2019s pre-injury wage. \n\uf0b7 The state average weekly wage (SAWW) is currently $1,000. \n\uf0b7 The minimum indemnity benefit remains at 50% of the SAWW. \n\uf0b7 The maximum indemnity benefit is decreasing from 100% of the SAWW to 83.3% of the \nSAWW. \n\uf0b7 The distribution of workers (and their wages) according to how their wages compare to the \nSAWW is as follows: \n6.5 Benefit E xamp le\nRatio to \nAverage \nWeekly \nWage\n#", "type": "Document"}}
