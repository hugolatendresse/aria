Conceptually, \nretrospectively rated insurance is similar to self-insurance with the exception that retrospectively rated \ninsurance policies contain provisions that cause the insurer to retain some risk and that affect the timing \nof payments for costs incurred under the policy.  For example, the actual losses used to determine the \nfinal retrospective premium may be limited to reduce the effect of any single unusual or catastrophic \nevent.  Similarly, the total premium charged may be subject to a minimum and maximum amount, which \nhelps stabilize the year-to-year cost and further protects the insured from exceeding an aggregate cost due \nto a large number of claims incurred in any one year.  \n  \n15.16 Comp utation of Premium\n(1) Estimated Losses Above the Deductible $50,000\n(2) ALAE $110,000\n(3) Fixed Expenses\n     (a) Standard $50,000\n     (b) Deductible Processing $38,000\n(4) Credit Risk $9,500\n(5) Risk Margin $5,000\n(6) Variable Expenses and Profit 15%\n(7) Premium $308,824\n(1) = Table 15.15, Row (3)\n(2) = 11% x Table 15.15, Row (1)\n(3a) = Provided\n(3b) = 4% x Table 15.15, Row (1) x LER in Table 15.14\n(4) = 1% x Table 15.15, Row (1) x LER in Table 15.14\n(5) = 10% x (1)\n(7) = [(1) + (2) + (3a) + (3b) + (4) + (5)] / [1.0 - (6)]", "type": "Document"}}
