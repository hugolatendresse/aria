Instead, the rating variables and rating algorithm were adjusted to \naddress the inequities.  This debate over the choice of workers compensation exposure base continues to \nreemerge.   \nThe following table shows the exposure bases currently used for different lines of business.  Multi-peril \npackage policies such as commercial general liability use different exposure bases for pricing different \naspects of the package policy.  \n \nEXPOSURES\tFOR\tLARGE\tCOMMERCIAL\tRISKS\t\nLarge commercial risks present unique challenges for ratemaking and for the use of more conventional \nexposure bases.  As a result, ratemaking for large commercial risks is often done via composite rating and \nloss-rated composite rating.   \nComposite rating is used for some large commercial risks when the amount of exposure is difficult to \ntrack throughout the policy period.  For example, some commercial multi-peril policies use different \nexposure measures for each aspect of coverage (e.g., sales revenue for general liability, amount of \ninsurance or property value for commercial business property).  The policy premium is initially calculated \nusing estimates for each exposure measure along with the relevant rating algorithms for each \ncoverage.  These individual exposure estimates, however, are expected to change throughout the course of \nthe policy term.  Rather than auditing each exposure measure, a proxy measure is used to gauge the \noverall change in exposure to loss.  For example, if property value is chosen as the proxy exposure \nmeasure, a 20% increase in property value during the policy term would trigger a premium adjustment of \n20% for the whole policy\u2019s premium. \nIn loss-rated composite rating, premium is calculated based on the individual risk\u2019s historical loss \nexperience (i.e., without any use of standard rating algorithms).  In that case, the implicit exposure base is \nthe risk.  This rating technique is discussed in more detail in Chapter 15.", "type": "Document"}}
