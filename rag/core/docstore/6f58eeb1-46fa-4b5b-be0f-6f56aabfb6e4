The total unpaid claims estimate is equal to estimated IBNR \nplus case outstanding.  \n \nWe observe an unusually low value of IBNR for accident year 2004 (-$1,950) when compared \nwith the immediate preceding year ($3,611) and immediate following year ($9,340). Thus, we \nreturn to the data to see if we can identify anything unusual in either the claims or the severity for \nthis particular year. The closed claim counts in Exhibit V, Sheet 1 seem reasonable when \ncompared with other years. We do note, however, that the paid severity for accident year 2004 at \n60 months is low when compared to prior accident years at 60 months and compared to accident \nyear 2005 at 48 months. We also note an unusually high case outstanding for accident year 2004 \nin comparison with other years. The estimate of total unpaid claims for 2004, however, is \nreasonable when compared to other years. Accident year 2003 seems to have similar issues. The \nincremental paid severity for accident year 2003 is unusually low when compared to other \naccident years, and the IBNR is lower than usual when compared to accident years 2002 and \n2005. \n \nThis exemplifies the type of questioning and probing that the actuary should undertake when \nreviewing the results of any technique used for estimating unpaid claims. The actuary should turn \nto claims department management of the insurer to understand the reasons for the high value of \ncase outstanding and the low values for average payments, and to determine if there are any \nfactors that might preclude the use of this type of projection methodology. \n \n \nAnalysis for XYZ Insurer \n \nBefore we begin this frequency-severity analysis for XYZ Insurer, we recall from Chapter 6, that \nthe closed claim counts for XYZ Insurer exclude claims closed with no payment (CNP) and that \npaid claims include partial payments as well as payments on closed claims.
