This includes \nnot only such items as inclusion of ALAE, but also whether the past or current exposure is considered.  \nFor the four comparison combinations listed above, the first three consider past exposure and the fourth \nconsiders current exposure. \nExpected losses are usually estimated as the product of an expected loss rate and an exposure measure.  \nThe expected loss rate is the expected loss cost reflected in the manual rates; moreover, it can reflect \neither the prior or current period.  If the loss rates are needed for a prior period, the expected loss rate can \nbe based on the manual rates for the prior period or based on manual rates for the current period, adjusted \nto the appropriate dollar level (i.e., de-trended).  If the two sets of manual rates are considerably different, \nthe actuary should understand the reason and assess which approach is appropriate for the situation.   \nOther\tConsiderations\t\nThe experience rating modification factor (or experience \u201cmod\u201d) may be subjected to maximum or \nminimum changes.  Another consideration in the application of experience rating is when the total \npremium under the experience rating plan does not equal the total expected premium.  The necessary \nadjustment, often referred to as off-balance correction, is discussed in detail in Chapter 14. \nExample\tExperience\tRating\tPlan\t\u2013\tCommercial\tGeneral\tLiability\t\nThe following example is a simplified version of the experience rating portion of the 1997 Insurance \nServices Office (ISO) Commercial General Liability Experience and Schedule Rating Plan.  References to \n\u201ccompany\u201d indicate the insurance company using the experience rating plan.  Each insurance company \nmay have different premium and expense assumptions for the same exposures.   \n \n  \n15.1  Trend ed  Projected  U ltimate Losses & ALAE  at Current E xp osure Lev el\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nPolicy", "type": "Document"}}
