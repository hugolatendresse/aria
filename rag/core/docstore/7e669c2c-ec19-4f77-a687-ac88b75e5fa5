The actuary can derive the proposed base rate via trial \nand error (i.e., testing various base rates until the target average premium is achieved).  Alternatively, the \nactuary can calculate the amount the seed base rate needs to be adjusted via formula.   \nRecall that the formula for the proposed average premium assuming a seed base rate is: \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b\uf05d\n,\n]210121 PPPP\np\nij k m\nijkm,m,k,j,i\nSS AX\nXDD.R[R\nBP \uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02d\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\n\uf0b4\uf03d\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5\n \nand the formula for the proposed average premium assuming the proposed base rate is: \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b\uf05d\np\nij k m\nijkm,m,k,j,i\nAX\nXDD.R[R\nBP \uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02d\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\n\uf0b4\uf03d\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5 ]210121 PPPP\nPP  \nThe only difference between these formulae is the base rate used (i.e., the former uses BS and the latter \nuses BP).   \nRearranging the terms and dividing one formula by the other yields: \n.P\nP\nPP\nSS B\nB\n)AP(\n)AP( \uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02d  \n \nThus, the proposed base rate in the extension of exposure method is derived by adjusting the seed base \nrate as follows: \n.\nP\nPP\nP\n)AP(\n)AP(BB\nS\nS\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d  \nIf no fixed expense fee or other additive premium applies, the calculation of the proposed base rate is \nsimple: \n.P\nP\nS\nS\nP\nPBB \uf0b4\uf03d  \nThe table below summarizes the calculation of the proposed base rate in the example, according to the \nformula provided earlier:", "type": "Document"}}
