Table 15.3 supports the \nderivation of certain inputs to Table 15.2. \nThe actual experience is represented by the projected ultimate losses and ALAE for the three-year \nexperience period, which consists of the reported losses and ALAE as of March 31, 2010, [given as 1(a) \nin Table 15.2] and the expected unreported losses and ALAE at March 31, 2010 (derived in column 8 of \nTable 15.3).  For both the reported and unreported losses and ALAE, losses are capped at basic limits and \na maximum single limit per occurrence (MSL) is applied to the basic limited losses and ALAE combined.  \nThe company subject basic limit loss and ALAE costs [1(d) in Table 15.2] represent the expected loss and \nALAE underlying the current rating manual rates adjusted to the dollar level of the experience period.", "type": "Document"}}
