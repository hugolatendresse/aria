The 5.0% change can be achieved by \nincreasing the base rate 5.0% and increasing the flat premium 5.0%.  Alternatively, if it is undesirable to \nchange flat premium (i.e., keep AP the same as AC), the base rate change needs to be increased such that \nthe total average premium change will be achieved.  This is because the base rate change only affects \nvariable premium.  If flat premium is assumed to be 10% of the total average premium (and the amount of \nflat premium is not changing with this rate review), the base rate has to increase by 5.56% in order to \nachieve the 5.0% overall change (i.e., 5.0% = 90% (5.56%) + 10% (0.0%)).   \nDerivation\tof\tBase\tRate:\t\tRate\tDifferential\tChanges\t\t\nThe next section describes three base rate derivation approaches to use if rate differentials are changing: \n\uf0b7 Extension of exposures \n\uf0b7 Approximated average rate differential \n\uf0b7 Approximated change in average rate differential \n \nThe extension of exposures method is the most direct and most accurate, but requires detailed data.
