The quality of the final rates \ndepends largely on the quality and quantity of data available.  \nMost ratemaking work involves analyzing the adequacy of rates for existing insurance products.  In this \ncase, companies generally use internal historical data or industry historical data to project future \nprofitability.  To facilitate a good review, it is imperative that the company collects and maintains \npertinent and consistent historical data.  When pricing a new insurance product, the actuary will need to \nsearch for internal information that may have some relationship to the new product or acquire relevant \nexternal data.    \nThis chapter provides high-level specifications for ratemaking data, introduces data aggregation methods, \nand provides insights on external data.  Often an actuary is required to perform ratemaking analysis with \nmore limited data than is discussed in this chapter.  In those cases, an actuary must understand the impact \nof not having particular information and should examine the sensitivity of the results of the analysis to the \nvarious assumptions.  With this understanding and the data that is available, the actuary can determine \ndata specifications in a manner that minimizes distortions in the results of the study.  \nINTERNAL\tDATA\t\nData requirements are a function of the type of ratemaking analyses being undertaken.  For example, it is \nnot essential to know the individual characteristics for each policy or risk to perform an analysis of the \nadequacy of the overall rates for a given product.  On the other hand, a full multivariate classification \nanalysis requires significant historical detail about each item being priced (e.g., an individual risk, policy, \nor class of policies).     \nTypically, ratemaking analyses are performed on existing insurance products and primarily involve the", "type": "Document"}}
