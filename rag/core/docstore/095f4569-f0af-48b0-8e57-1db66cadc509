From a practical perspective, it may be difficult to quantify the historical paid ULAE \nthat corresponds only to the accident year claims represented by L. Conceptually, this approach \nhas some similarities to, and shares the potential distortions of, an expected claims ratio approach \nto estimating unpaid claims. In the expected claim technique, unpaid claims are estimated based \non a predetermined expected claims ratio multiplied by earned premium less claims paid to date. \nAs the period matures, the unpaid claim estimate can become increasingly distorted if actual paid \nclaims do not approach the predetermined value of expected ultimate claims. \n \nThe method preferred by Conger and Nolibos is similar to a Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique in \nthat an a priori provision of unpaid ULAE is calculated. \n \nUnpaid ULAE = W* x (L - B) \n \nTo assist in understanding this method, Conger and Nolibos present the derivation of this estimate \n(for a particular group of accident years).
