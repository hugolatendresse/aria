At any time a \nclaims department may be working on settling claims that arise from events occurring during many \nhistorical time periods and pertaining to many lines of business.  Because of this, companies need to \nallocate ULAE to losses in a sensible way. \nA simple method for allocating ULAE is based on the assumption that ULAE expenditures track with loss \nand ALAE dollars consistently over time, both in terms of rate of payment and in proportion to the \namount of losses paid.  The procedure involves calculating the ratio of calendar year paid ULAE to \ncalendar year paid loss plus ALAE over several years (e.g., three years or longer, depending on the line of \nbusiness).  This ratio (see Table 6.23) is then applied to \neach year\u2019s reported loss plus ALAE to incorporate \nULAE.  The ratio is generally calculated on losses that \nhave not been adjusted for trend or development as this \ndata is readily available for other financial reporting.  \nThis inherently assumes that ULAE trend and develop \nat the same rate as loss plus ALAE.  The resulting ratio \nof ULAE to loss plus ALAE is then applied to loss plus \nALAE that has been adjusted for extraordinary events, \ndevelopment, and trend.  For lines of business where \nALAE is not substantial (e.g. homeowners), this \nadjustment may be done for ALAE and ULAE \ncombined. \nCatastrophic events can cause extraordinary loss adjustment expenses.  For example, in the event of a \nmajor catastrophe, a company may have to set up temporary offices in the catastrophe area.  To the extent \nthat those costs are significant and irregular, the historical ratio will be distorted.  Thus, catastrophe loss \nadjustment expenses are generally excluded from the standard ULAE analysis and are determined as part \nof the catastrophe provision.", "type": "Document"}}
