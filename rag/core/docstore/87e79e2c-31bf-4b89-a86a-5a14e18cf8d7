In the previous \nchapter, we point out the potential shortcomings of the claim development method for this \nparticular insurer. The primary assumption of the development technique is that future claims will \nbehave in a similar way as historical claims. Due to the various changes experienced by XYZ \nInsurer, this assumption does not likely hold true. We have several alternatives for consideration \nin selecting expected claim ratios for XYZ Insurer. First, we can turn to insurance industry \nexperience for benchmark claim ratios. For this particular jurisdiction and coverage, we know \nthat ultimate claim ratios for the aggregated experience of the insurance industry are \napproximately 50%. Since XYZ Insurer\u2019s undeveloped reported claim ratios (i.e., current value of \nreported claims prior to development divided by earned premiums) are greater than 70% for six \nof the seven earliest accident years in the experience period, the use of an industry claim ratio \ndoes not appear reasonable.  \n \nAnother alternative is to use the unadjusted reported and paid claim development methods as a \nstarting point. In Exhibit III, we use the reported and paid development methods to determine an \ninitial estimate of ultimate claims. Columns (2) through (8) present these calculations. For \naccident years 1998 through 2003, which are the most mature years in the experience period, we \nselect the expected claim ratio based on the average of the estimated claim ratios in Column (10).  \n \nFor the most recent accident years, 2004 through 2008, we select the expected claim ratios in \nExhibit III, Sheet 2. Columns (3) through (7) contain trend factors that adjust for inflation; we \nassume an annual claim trend rate of 3.425% (derived based on an annual frequency trend of", "type": "Document"}}
