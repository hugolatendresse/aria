Companies that \nchoose not to do so may face adverse selection.    \nThe past two chapters discussed traditional (univariate) and multivariate techniques that determine the \nindicated relativities between different levels of a given rating variable.  Certain rating variables and risk \ncharacteristics have unique qualities that led actuaries to develop special ratemaking procedures.   \nThis chapter discusses alternate ratemaking procedures to address the following items: \n\uf0b7 Territorial boundary analysis \n\uf0b7 Increased limits factors \n\uf0b7 Deductibles \n\uf0b7 Workers compensation size of risk \n\uf0b7 Insurance to value/Coinsurance \nTERRITORIAL\tRATEMAKING\t\nGeography is considered one of the primary drivers of claims experience.  Consequently, it is one of the \nmost well-established and widely used rating variables.  Companies typically define territories as a \ncollection of small geographic units (e.g., postal/zip codes, counties, census blocks) and have rate \nrelativities for each territory.  The territorial boundaries and associated rate relativities can vary \nsignificantly from insurer to insurer.   \nTerritorial ratemaking poses some interesting challenges.  First, location tends to be heavily correlated \nwith other rating variables (e.g., high-value homes tend to be located in the same area), which makes \ntraditional univariate analysis of location very susceptible to distortions.  Second, as companies often \nanalyze territory as a collection of small units, the data in each individual territory is sparse.  This is \nreferred to as high-dimensionality, and special multivariate techniques are required to circumvent the \nproblem.  \nTerritorial ratemaking generally involves two phases:  \n\uf0b7 Establishing territorial boundaries", "type": "Document"}}
