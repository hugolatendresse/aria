Similar values for the projected average expense per exposure imply \nexpenses are increasing or decreasing proportionately to exposures.  This relationship may hold for some \nexpenses, but may not be accurate for all fixed expenses due to economies of scale.  If the company is \ngrowing and the projected average expense per exposure is declining steadily each year, then it is an \nindication that expenses may not be increasing as quickly as exposures due to economies of scale.  If the \ndecline is significant and the actuary believes it is because of economies of scale, then the selection \nshould be adjusted to include the impact of economies of scale given expected growth in the book of \nbusiness.27   \nAs mentioned earlier, non-recurring expense items, one-time changes in expense levels, or anticipated \nchanges in expenses should be considered in making the selection.  In the example shown, the three-year \naverage expense ratio is selected.  If the rate level indication approach requires that the fixed expense be \nexpressed as a percentage of premium (as is the case with the loss ratio approach discussed in Chapter 8), \nthen the average fixed expense per exposure should be divided by the projected average premium.   \n.

In other words, the variable expenses are divided by the historical premium.  \nAs stated above, the three-year average variable expense provision is selected for this example.   \nOther\tConsiderations/Enhancements\t\nWhile the Exposure/Policy-based Projection Method does correct for the distortions inherent in the", "type": "Document"}}
