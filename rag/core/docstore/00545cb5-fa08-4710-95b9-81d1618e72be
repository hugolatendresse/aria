Three such examples are as follows: \n\uf0b7 The initial premium for a retrospectively rated policy may be based on the total expected \nexpenses, profit, and costs associated with any caps.  At the end of the policy period, the insured \nwill be billed annually for all losses incurred under the policy after consideration of any capping \nrules contained in the policy.  These adjustments will continue each year for a pre-determined \nlength of time.  The annual amount billed is referred to as a premium adjustment. \n\uf0b7 The initial premium may be based on expenses, profit, and costs associated with any caps but \nexcluding LAE associated with the policy.  In this case, the annual premium adjustments \nassociated with reported losses during the policy period will include a provision for LAE costs.  \nThe provision is typically based on a pre-determined percentage chosen to reflect LAE costs.   \n\uf0b7 The initial premium may be based on an estimate of the final premium under the policy, including \nprovision for total expected ultimate losses and expenses.  In this case, the periodic premium \nadjustments are due to changes in the revised estimate of the final premium based on up-to-date \nloss information. \n \nIn theory, all three examples above should produce the same total premium for a given retrospectively \nrated policy; however, the amount of the initial premium and premium adjustments will vary, resulting in \ncash flow timing differences. \nExample\tRetrospective\tRating\tPlan\t\u2013\tWorkers\tCompensation", "type": "Document"}}
