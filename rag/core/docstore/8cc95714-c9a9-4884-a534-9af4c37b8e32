The insurer, who may have an active claims department, may need an IA to handle a \nspecific type of claim or a claim in a particular region where the insurer does not have the \nnecessary expertise. Also when a disaster occurs, such as a hurricane or earthquake, the insurer \nmay hire a number of IAs (or a firm of IAs) to handle the large volume of claims. The \ncompensation for the services of IAs is generally based on a fee per claim. \n \n \nA Claim is Reported \n \nThe estimation process for unpaid claims begins when an insured first reports a claim, or notice \nof an event, to the insurer. Insureds may report claims in several ways, including but not limited \nto: telephone (often to a call center), Internet (the insurer\u2019s Web site), e-mail, in person at an \ninsurer\u2019s branch office, notice to an insurance intermediary (such as an insurance agent or \nbroker), or a lawyer\u2019s letter with a formal statement of claim. A claims professional of the insurer \nthen reviews the initial claim report.  \n  \nThe first decision a claims adjuster, either internal or external to the insurer, encounters is \nwhether or not the reported claim is covered under the terms of a valid policy. To determine \nwhether the reported incident represents a covered claim and to assist in the establishment of an \ninitial case outstanding estimate, claims professionals generally review the following: \n \n\uf0be Effective dates of the policy \n\uf0be Date of occurrence \n\uf0be Terms and conditions of the policy \n\uf0be Policy exclusions \n\uf0be Policy endorsements  \n\uf0be Policy limits \n\uf0be Deductibles \n\uf0be Reinsurance or excess coverage \n\uf0be Reporting requirements \n\uf0be Mitigation of loss requirements \n\uf0be Extent of injury and damages \n\uf0be Extent of fault \n\uf0be Potential other parties at fault  \n\uf0be Potential other sources of recovery", "type": "Document"}}
