Accident \nyear paid losses are the sum of all payments made on any claims that occurred during the year (i.e., the \ndate of accident is during that year).  Accident year reported losses consist of all loss payments made plus \nthe case reserves as of the valuation date for those claims that occurred during the year.  Unlike calendar \nyear losses, accident year losses can and do change after the end of the year as additional claims are \nreported, claims are paid, or reserves are changed.  Since accident year is not closed (fixed) at the end of \nthe year, future development of losses needs to be estimated. \nPolicy year aggregation, which is sometimes referred to as underwriting year, considers all loss \ntransactions on policies that were written during the year, regardless of when the claim occurred or when \nit was reported, reserved, or paid.  Policy year paid losses are the sum of all payments made on claims \ncovered by policies written during the year.  Policy year reported losses are the sum of the policy year \npaid losses and the case reserves as of the valuation date for claims covered by policies written during the \nyear.  Like accident year losses, policy year losses can and often do change as additional claims occur, \nclaims are paid, or reserves are changed.  Because a policy year extends until the last policy (which may \nbe written on the last day of the year) expires, policy year claims associated with annual policies arise \nfrom a two year time period, a longer period than calendar year and accident year losses.
