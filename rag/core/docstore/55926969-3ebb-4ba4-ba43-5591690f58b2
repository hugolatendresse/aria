For the first four years in the experience period \n(2002 through 2005) at 12 months of development, the ratio of closed-to-reported claim counts was \nroughly 0.14. For each of the last three years (at 12 months), the ratio is in excess of 0.20; and for \nthe latest year it is 0.266. We observe the same type of increases for the 24-month through 48-\nmonth development periods. At 24 months, the ratio of closed-to-reported claim counts for the \nlatest accident year, 2007, is 0.626 and for the earliest year, 2002, is 0.401; at 36 months, the ratio \nfor the latest accident year, 2006, is 0.725 and for the earliest year, 2002, is 0.543. \n \nThe experience of closed and reported claim counts is consistent with management\u2019s report of \ngreater emphasis on settling claims faster.  After concluding that management\u2019s efforts have \nindeed had an effect on the claims settlement patterns, the actuary must then consider the \nconsequences of such a change. Generally, insurers are able to close the less complicated and less \nexpensive claims the quickest. The closure of more complicated claims, which tend to involve \nlitigation and expert witnesses, are often less in the control of the insurer since third parties play a \nsignificant role in the claims settlement process.
