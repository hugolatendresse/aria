Specifically, we build \ndevelopment triangles for paid claims, case outstanding, reported claims, and reported claim \ncounts based on detailed information for a set of 15 claims observed over a four-year time \nhorizon. In this chapter, we develop estimates of ultimate claims and unpaid claims based on the \nreported and paid claim development methods. The development technique, also known as the \nchain ladder technique, is one of the most frequently used methodologies for estimating unpaid \nclaims.  \n \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nThe distinguishing characteristic of the development method is that ultimate claims for each \naccident year are produced from recorded values assuming that future claims\u2019 development is \nsimilar to prior years\u2019 development. In this method, the actuary uses the development triangles to \ntrack the development history of a specific group of claims. The underlying assumption in the \ndevelopment technique is that claims recorded to date will continue to develop in a similar manner \nin the future \u2013 that the past is indicative of the future. That is, the development technique assumes \nthat the relative change in a given year\u2019s claims from one evaluation point to the next is similar to \nthe relative change in prior years\u2019 claims at similar evaluation points.  \n \nAn implicit assumption in the development technique is that, for an immature accident year, the \nclaims observed thus far tell you something about the claims yet to be observed. This is in \ncontrast to the assumptions underlying the expected claims technique (Chapter 8), the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique (Chapter 9), and the Cape Cod technique (Chapter 10). \n \nOther important assumptions of the development method include: consistent claim processing, a \nstable mix of types of claims, stable policy limits, and stable reinsurance (or excess insurance)", "type": "Document"}}
