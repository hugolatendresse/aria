We \npresent a range of estimated unpaid ULAE assuming that pure IBNR is equal to either 4% of \nthe latest accident year ultimate claims or 6% of the latest accident year ultimate claims. \n \nIn practice, many actuaries only use one method to estimate unpaid ULAE. In determining \nwhich method to use, an actuary should have a selection criterion for assessing the various \nalternative methods. One approach many actuaries rely on is to evaluate the results in terms of \nthe number of years of payments indicated by the unpaid estimate. The expected number of \nfuture year payments will vary depending on the types of insurance in insurer\u2019s portfolio. For \nexample, for short-tail lines of insurance, the actuary may expect the estimate of unpaid \nULAE to represent one to two years of additional calendar year payments. However, for long-\ntail lines of coverage, the estimated unpaid ULAE may be expected to represent three to four \nyears of payments.  \n408", "type": "Document"}}
