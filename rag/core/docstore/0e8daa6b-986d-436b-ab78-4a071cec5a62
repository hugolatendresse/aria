The chapter discusses the benefits of multivariate approaches and provides a basic \nexplanation of the mathematical foundation of one commonly used multivariate method, generalized \nlinear models (GLMs).  Sample output with explanation is provided for GLM results as well as associated \nstatistical diagnostics.  The chapter also reviews some commonly used data mining techniques. \n \nChapter 11 addresses additional classification ratemaking techniques that were developed to address the \nunique qualities of some rating variables or risk characteristics.  These include territory boundary \nanalysis, increased limits factors, deductibles, size of risk for workers compensation insurance, and the \nconcept of insurance to value and how it affects the adequacy of rates. \n \nChapter 12 provides a broad overview of the credibility procedures used in ratemaking.  This includes \nmethods for incorporating credibility in an actuarial estimate, desirable qualities for the complement of \ncredibility (the related data that is blended with the original actuarial estimate), and methods and \nexamples for determining the complement of credibility. \n \nChapter 13 explores other items company management should consider, along with the actuarial \nindications discussed in the previous chapters, to determine what rates to charge in practice.  These \nconsiderations include regulatory constraints, operational constraints, and market conditions. \n \nChapter 14 discusses non-pricing and pricing solutions to an imbalanced fundamental insurance equation \n(i.e., current rates do not produce an average premium that is equivalent to the sum of expected costs and \ntarget underwriting profit).  In regards to pricing solutions, the chapter discusses how to calculate final \nrates for an existing product, as well as how to develop rates for a new product by referencing other data \nsources.  The chapter concludes with comments regarding the importance of communicating expected rate", "type": "Document"}}
