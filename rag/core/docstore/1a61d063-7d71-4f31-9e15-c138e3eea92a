The general approach is to calculate a limited \naverage severity for each layer of loss and combine the estimates for each layer taking into consideration \nthe probability of a claim occurring in the layer.  The limited average severity of each layer is based \nsolely on loss data from policies with limits as high as or higher than the upper limit of the layer.     \nFor example, when calculating the LAS ($100K), the actuary can use the experience from all policies \n(even those with limits above $100,000) and censor at $100,000: \n.,$,\n,,$\n,,\n)(,$,,$,,$,,$\n046770005\n223229385LAS($100K)\n0005\n2325747730001001117683521490334898657156LAS($100K)\n\uf03d\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\n \nWhen calculating the LAS ($250,000), the actuary cannot use the policies that have a $100,000 limit as \nthere is no way to know what the claim amounts would be if each of those policies had a limit of \n11.4 Uncensored Loss Distribution of Policies with $100,000 Limit\nReported \nClaims Reported Losses\n      X <= 100,000$      922 46,957,898 $        \n100,000$      <  X  <= 250,000$      787 127,573,028 $      \n250,000$      <  X  <= 500,000$      282 92,665,855 $        \n500,000$      < X <= 1,000,000$   28 16,640,606 $        \n2,019 283,837,387$     \nSize of Loss\nTotal\n11.5 Censored Loss Distribution of Policies with $100,000 Limit\nClaims Losses Claims Losses\n      X  <= 100,000$      922 46,957,898 $        2,019 156,657,898 $", "type": "Document"}}
