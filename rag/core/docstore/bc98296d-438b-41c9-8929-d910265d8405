These differences suggest that the actuary should review alternative \nprojection methods. \n \n \nInfluence of a Changing Environment on the Claim Development Technique \n \nChanges in Claim Ratios48 and Case Outstanding Adequacy \n \nTo examine the effect of a changing environment on the estimates produced by the development \ntechnique, we construct an example based on characteristics seen in the U.S. private passenger \nautomobile example. We use similar reporting and payment patterns as well as a similar ultimate \nclaim ratio. We compare the estimated IBNR generated by the development technique to the \n\u201cactual IBNR\u201d49 under the following four scenarios:  \n \n\uf0be Scenario 1 is a steady-state environment where claim ratios are stable and there are no \nchanges from historical levels of case outstanding strength (U.S. PP Auto Steady-State) \n \n\uf0be Scenario 2 is an environment of increasing claim ratios and no change in case outstanding \nstrength (U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim Ratios) \n \n\uf0be Scenario 3 is an environment of stable claim ratios with an increase in case outstanding \nstrength (U.S. PP Auto Increasing Case Outstanding Strength) \n \n\uf0be Scenario 4 is an environment where there are increases in both claim ratios and case \noutstanding strength (U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim Ratios and Case Outstanding Strength) \n                                                 \n48 Because we specifically chose to use the term claims instead of losses, we refer to a claim ratio instead of \na loss ratio. This claim ratio should be understood to refer to dollars of claims and not claim counts.  \n \n49 See the next section, \u201cKey Assumptions,\u201d for description of \u201cactual IBNR.\u201d \n98", "type": "Document"}}
