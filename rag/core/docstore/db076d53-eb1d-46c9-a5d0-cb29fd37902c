For two of the latest three accident years at \n12 months, the average case outstanding is greater than $20,000. We see similar increases at 24 \nand 36 months. At 24 months, the average case outstanding for accident years 2002 and 2003 was \nless than $15,000; for accident years 2006 and 2007 at the same development age, the average \ncase outstanding values are both greater than $40,000.
