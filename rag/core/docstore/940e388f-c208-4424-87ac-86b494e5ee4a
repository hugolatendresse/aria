Generally speaking, a deviance is a single figure measure of how much the fitted values differ \nfrom the observations.  Deviance tests are often used when comparing nested models (one is a subset of \nthe other) to assess whether the additional variable(s) in the broader model are worth including.  The \ndeviance of each model is scaled and the results are compared.  Statistical tests such as Chi-Square or F-\ntest are used to gauge the theoretical trade-off between the gain in accuracy by adding the variables versus \nthe loss of parsimony in adding more parameter estimates to be solved.  Similarly, deviance tests such as \nAkaike Information Criteria (AIC) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) can be applied to non-nested \nmodels. \nAn example of a practical diagnostic in the modeling process is comparing the GLM results for individual \nyears (assuming a multi-year dataset) to gauge consistency of results from one year to the next.36  The \nfollowing graph shows the effect of vehicle symbol on automobile collision frequency separately for the \ntwo years present in the experience period.
