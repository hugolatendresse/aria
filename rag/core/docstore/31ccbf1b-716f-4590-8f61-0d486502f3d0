Even so, the U.K. also places some pricing restrictions on \nwhat insurers can and cannot do.  For example, European Union (E.U.) legislation regarding personal \nautomobile insurance requires that, in the U.K., insurers must be prepared to demonstrate that the gender \nrelativities in their rates be proportionate to underlying risk relativities (i.e., insurers should not deviate \nconsiderably from actuarial indications regarding gender relativities).  Currently, there is also a debate in \nthe E.U. and U.K. about potential legislation that might restrict the treatment of age as a rating variable in \na similar way to gender. \nIn many of the Latin American markets, the regulation of insurance rates is focused more on rate \nadequacy (i.e., ensuring that insurers collect the minimum premium necessary to meet their obligations) \nthan equity among classifications.  Generally, Latin American rating plans are unsophisticated.  One \nexception is Brazil, in which carriers utilize a wider range of rating variables on some products (e.g., \npersonal automobile) and rates are required to be filed with the regulators for approval.  \nIn many developing markets like India, rate regulation is heavier on compulsory coverages (e.g., personal \nautomobile liability), but other insurance products are deregulated and operate more on open competition.  \nDespite the rate deregulation, the rating plans are still relatively simple because of the lack of credible \ndata collected. \nExamples\tof\tU.S.\tRegulatory\tConstraints\t\nIn some jurisdictions around the world, insurance regulation may preclude the use of certain actuarially \nindicated rates or rate differentials.  The following are U.S. examples of regulatory constraints that may \ncause a company to implement rates that are different from those indicated by its ratemaking analyses.", "type": "Document"}}
