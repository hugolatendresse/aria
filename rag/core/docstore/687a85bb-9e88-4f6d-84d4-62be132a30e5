Advances in computing power have enabled such techniques to \nbe applied to individual policies.  On the other hand, some companies may have policy information \nsummarized on a monthly or quarterly basis and will need to calculate the exposures for the block of \npolicies using this summarized data.  In such a case, it is customary for the practitioner to treat all policies \nas if they were written on the mid-point of the period.  For example, when data is summarized on a \nmonthly basis, all policies are assumed to be written on the 15th of the month.  This practice is often \nreferred to as the \u201c15th of the month\u201d rule or the \u201c24ths\u201d method.  This will be a good approximation as \nlong as policies are written uniformly during each time period.  If this approach is applied to longer \nperiods (e.g., quarters or years), the assumption of uniform writings is less likely to be reasonable.   \nTo clarify the application of this rule, consider the following example in which a company begins writing \nannual policies in 2010 and writes 240 exposures each month.  \nThe in-force exposures represent the \ntotal exposures from active policies at a \ngiven point in time.  While it is \nreasonable to assume that some of the \n240 exposures written in July were in-\nforce as of the first day of the month, the \n\u201c15th of the month\u201d rule assumes that \nnone of the exposures from the July \npolicies contribute to the in-force \nexposures as of July 1, 2010.  This is \nbecause the rule assumes all the July \npolicies are written on July 15th.   Table \n4.23 shows the in-force exposures as of \nJuly 1, 2010; January 1, 2010; and July \n1, 2011, respectively. \n \n4.22 In-force E xp osure b y Date\nNumber of \nHous es  \nIns ured 0 1/01 /11 0 6/1 5/1 1 0 1/0 1/12\nA1 0 / 0 1 / 1 0 0 3 / 3 1 / 1 1 1 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 0", "type": "Document"}}
