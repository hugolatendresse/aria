For example, when an insurer has recently entered a new line \nof business or a new territory and there is not yet a credible volume of historical claim \ndevelopment experience, an actuary may use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. In such \ncircumstances, the actuary would likely need to rely on benchmarks, either from similar lines at \nthe same insurer or insurance industry experience, for development patterns and expected claim \nratios (or pure premiums). (See previous comments about the use of industry benchmarks.) \n \nIn a discussion of when to use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method in the paper \u201cThe Actuary and \nIBNR,\u201d the authors state: \u201cIt can be argued that the most prudent course is, when in doubt, to use \nexpected losses, in as much as it is certainly indicated for volatile lines, and in the case of a stable \nline, the expected loss ratio should be predictable enough so that both techniques produce the \nsame result.\u201d56 \n \nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique can be a useful method for very short-tail lines as well as \nlong-tail lines. For very short-tail lines, the IBNR can be set equal to a multiple of the last few \nmonths\u2019 earned premium; this is essentially an application of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \ntechnique. \n                                                 \n55 Recall that the formula for the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is:  \nUltimate Claims = Actual Reported Claims + Expected Unreported Claims \nThus, for the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson projection, the expected unreported claims are equal to the \nestimated IBNR. \n \n56 PCAS, 1972. \n155", "type": "Document"}}
