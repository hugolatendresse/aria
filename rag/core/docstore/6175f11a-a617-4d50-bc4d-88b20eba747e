In these cases, the expected size of loss distribution may vary \nsignificantly from one policy to the next, and it may be more appropriate to use a threshold that is a \npercentage of the amount of insurance than to use a fixed threshold.   \nIn terms of the fundamental insurance equation, indicated rates will be understated if actual shock losses \nhave been removed from projected losses and no provision for shock losses has been added.  The actual \nshock loss is typically replaced with an average expected large loss amount that is calculated based on a \nlonger term view of the effect of such events.  The length of time used to determine the true effect of such \nevents may vary significantly for different lines of business and even from insurer to insurer.  For \nexample, a medium-sized homeowners insurer may derive a good estimate for expected large fire losses \nusing 10 years of data, while a small personal umbrella insurer may need 20 years of data.  The actuary \nalso wants to avoid using too many years as older data becomes less relevant over time (e.g., jury awards \nmay be much higher today than previously).  If there are no data limitations, the average should be based \non the number of years necessary to produce a stable and reasonable estimate without including so many \nyears as to make the historical data irrelevant.      \nThe following example shows a simple procedure that caps individual reported losses at $1,000,000 \n(these capped losses are referred to as non-excess losses) and uses the long-term average ratio of excess \nlosses (the portion of each shock loss above the $1,000,000 threshold) to non-excess losses to determine \nan excess loss provision.  The assumption implicit in this procedure is that while the proportion of losses \nattributable to extraordinary losses will be volatile in the short-run, the proportion will be stable when \nviewed over a sufficiently long period of time.", "type": "Document"}}
