Thus, we \nassume that the adequacy of the case outstanding is not changing over time or at least is relatively \nstable other than inflationary pressures. If there has been a change in the adequacy of case \noutstanding over the experience period, then the fundamental assumption of the development \nmethod does not hold and the method will most likely not produce reliable results of ultimate \nclaims or unpaid claims. \n \nIt is very important that the actuary test the appropriateness of underlying assumptions prior to \nrelying on the results of any particular method. There are several approaches that an actuary can \nuse to determine if an insurer has sustained changes in case outstanding adequacy. As we discuss \nin Chapter 6, one of the most important sources of information for the actuary is the claims \ndepartment management of the insurer. A meeting with claims department management to \ndiscuss the claims process should be a prerequisite to any analysis of unpaid claims. The actuary \ncan also calculate various claim development diagnostic tests, including: the ratio of paid-to-\nreported claims, average case outstanding, average reported claim, and average paid claims. In \ntheir medical malpractice example, Berquist and Sherman compare the annual change in the \naverage case outstanding to the annual change in the average paid claims to confirm a shift in \ncase outstanding adequacy. \n \nWe begin our testing of the underlying assumptions in Exhibit I, Sheet 4 with a review of the \naverage case outstanding triangle. (Note that the average case outstanding triangle is the \nunadjusted case outstanding divided by the open claim counts in Exhibit I, Sheet 4.) When we", "type": "Document"}}
