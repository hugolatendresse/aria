Determining the supplier-side price \nto charge for any given product is conceptually straightforward.  The simplest model focuses on the idea \nthat the price should reflect the costs associated with the product as well as incorporate an acceptable \nmargin for profit.  The following formula depicts this simple relationship between price, cost, and profit:      \n Profit. Cost   Price \uf02b\uf03d         \nFor many non-insurance goods and services, the production cost is known before the product is sold.  \nTherefore, the initial price can be set so that the desired profit per unit of product will be achieved.   \nInsurance is different from most products as it is a promise to do something in the future if certain events \ntake place during a specified time period.  For example, insurance may be a promise to pay for the \nrebuilding of a home if it burns to the ground or to pay for medical treatment for a worker injured on the \njob.  Unlike a can of soup, a pair of shoes, or a car, the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known \nat the time of the sale.  This places the classic equation in a somewhat different context and introduces \nadditional complexity into the process of price setting for an insurance company.  \nThe purpose of this text is to outline the fundamentals of setting insurance prices, which is referred to as \nratemaking in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance industry.  In addition to the ratemaking concepts \noutlined in each chapter, the appendices to this text provide realistic numeric examples of ratemaking \nanalysis. \nRATING\tMANUALS\t\nThe price the insurance consumer pays is referred to as premium, and the premium is generally calculated \nbased on a given rate per unit of risk exposed.
