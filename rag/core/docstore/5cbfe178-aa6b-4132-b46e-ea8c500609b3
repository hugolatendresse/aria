In our example, there is considerable stability of factors \nespecially for the factors in age intervals of 24-36 months and later. For both reported and \npaid claims, we observe the greatest variability in age-to-age factors at the 12-24 month \nperiod. This is not unexpected as claims at the earlier ages are at their most immature state, \nwhen the claims professional has the least amount of information about the circumstances of \nthe insured event as well as the potential damages and injuries of claimants. \n \n\u2015 Credibility of the experience. Actuaries generally determine credibility based on the volume \nand the homogeneity of the experience for a given accident year and age. If the claim \ndevelopment experience of the insurer has limited credibility because of the limited volume \nof claims, organizational changes, or other factors, it may be necessary to use benchmark \ndevelopment factors from the insurance industry. (See the earlier discussion about the use of \nindustry benchmarks.)  \n \n\u2015 Changes in patterns. Actuaries review the age-to-age factors to identify systematic patterns \nthat may suggest changes in the internal operations or external environment. We address this \nissue at length in Chapter 6. \n \n\u2015 Applicability of the historical experience. Actuaries determine the appropriateness of \nhistorical age-to-age factors for projecting future claim development based on qualitative \ninformation regarding changes in the book of business and insurer operations over time. \nActuaries also consider the effect of changes in external factors that have not yet manifested \nthemselves in the reported claims experience. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n \n40 The Academy is on record for recommending against the reliance and heavy use of insurance industry \nbenchmarks, unless necessary due to low credibility. \n88", "type": "Document"}}
