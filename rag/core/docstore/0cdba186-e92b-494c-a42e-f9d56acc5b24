However, because credit score is often perceived to \nbe correlated with certain socio-demographic variables, some jurisdictions have placed limitations on the \nuse of credit and some have banned the use of credit altogether. \nSome regulations prescribe the use of certain ratemaking techniques.  For example, the state of \nWashington currently requires that multivariate classification analysis be used to develop rate relativities \nif insurance credit score is used to differentiate premium in personal automobile insurance.  Other states \nprescribe the use of a certain method for incorporating investment income in the derivation of the target \nunderwriting provision (further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this text). \nIn addition, there are times when the company actuary and the regulator have differing views on certain \nratemaking assumptions, which often leads to a different set of indicated rates.  For example, a regulator \nmay disagree with the method the actuary used to calculate loss trend, or may disagree with the trend \nselected.  There are numerous examples of differences of opinion, and these differences have to be \nrecognized when finalizing what rates are to be charged in practice.  In particular, there may be a cost \n(e.g., delayed implementation of new rates, requirement of specialized staff resources) associated with \nnegotiating with the regulator to resolve such differences. \nRegardless of the company\u2019s rate indications, a company must charge rates that comply with the \napplicable state regulations.  Fortunately, the regulations typically apply uniformly to all companies; \ntherefore, all companies face the same limitations.
