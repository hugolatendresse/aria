Thus, there are no changes in the cumulative claim \ndevelopment factors between the increasing claim ratio scenario and the steady-state \nenvironment. (Compare Columns (6) and (7) in the top and bottom sections of Exhibit III, Sheet \n10.) In Exhibit III, Sheet 10, we note that the projected ultimate claims are the same for the \nreported and paid claim development techniques, and that they are significantly greater for the \nincreasing claim ratio scenario ($10,249,350 for all years combined) than for the steady-state \nenvironment ($8,804,525 for all years combined). Since the claim development factors to \nultimate are the same, the higher value of projected ultimate claims is solely due to higher values \nof claims reported and paid as of December 31, 2008. We observe that the estimated IBNR, \nwhich is the same for both the reported and paid claim development methods, are equal to the \nactual IBNR in this scenario. Thus, we can conclude that the development technique is responsive \nto changes in the underlying claim ratios assuming no changes in the underlying claims reporting \nor payment pattern.  \n \n \nScenario 3 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Case Outstanding Strength \n \nExhibit III, Sheets 6 and 7 contain the claim development triangles for this scenario; we present \ndetailed calculations for projected ultimate claims and estimated IBNR in the top section of \nExhibit III, Sheet 11. In building the reported claim development triangle, we assume that the \ncase outstanding adequacy increased by 6% in 2007 and 25% in 2008 over the steady-state case \noutstanding (for the latest four accident years only). Thus, the next to last diagonal of the case \noutstanding triangle is 6% greater in this scenario than the steady-state scenario; and the last", "type": "Document"}}
