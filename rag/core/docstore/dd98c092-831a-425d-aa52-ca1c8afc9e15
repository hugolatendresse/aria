For claims that occurred during 2006, the insurer paid $460 during 2006 \nand 2007 and $230 during 2008. We use the same approach for each accident year grouping of \nclaims to derive the following triangle of incremental paid claims. \n \nTable 7 \u2013 Incremental Paid Claim Triangle \nAccident Incremental Paid Claims as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 \n2005 600 620 300 300 \n2006 460 460 230  \n2007 660 660   \n2008 700    \n \nThe incremental paid claim triangle is important for diagnostic purposes and for some frequency-\nseverity techniques. However, actuaries tend to use cumulative paid claim triangles more often \nthan incremental paid claim triangles. We can readily create the following cumulative paid claim \ntriangle from the incremental paid claim triangle.  \n \nTable 8 \u2013 Cumulative Paid Claim Triangle \nAccident Cumulative Paid Claims as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 \n2005 600 1,220 1,520 1,820 \n2006 460 920 1,150  \n2007 660 1,320   \n2008 700    \n \nWe derive the cumulative paid claim triangle by simple arithmetic from the incremental paid claim \ntriangle. The first column in both triangles, age 12 months, is the same for both paid claim triangles \n(i.e., incremental paid claims are equal to cumulative paid claims at the first maturity age). To \nderive the second column of the cumulative paid claim triangle, we add the second column (i.e., age \n24 months) of the incremental paid claim triangle to the first column of either triangle. The \ncumulative paid claims at 36 months are equal to the cumulative paid claims at 24 months plus the \nincremental paid claims at 36 months. Finally, the cumulative paid claims at 48 months are equal to \nthe cumulative paid claims at 36 months plus the incremental paid claims at 48 months.  \n \nBefore moving on to the other development triangles (e.g., case outstanding, reported claims, and", "type": "Document"}}
