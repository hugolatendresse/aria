(See Exhibit III, Sheet 2.) We observe that the ratios of paid \nULAE-to-actual paid claims are much more volatile than the ratios of paid ULAE-to-expected \npaid claims. We observe a pronounced downward trend in the paid ULAE-to-expected paid \nclaims ratios. We seek to understand the reasons behind this trend by reviewing the assumptions \nunderlying the development of expected paid claims and through discussions with management \nabout actual paid ULAE.  \n \nOne explanation could be that the industry-based payments pattern for developing expected paid \nclaims may be too fast for this particular insurer. We recognize that until a sufficient volume of \ncredible experience is developed, we are challenged in the selection of appropriate development \npatterns. Another explanation of the variability and downward trends could be related to large \n401", "type": "Document"}}
