Policy year aggregation \nas of a certain point in time would follow the formula immediately above.  Calendar year aggregation, \nhowever, would need to consider the unearned exposures at the beginning of the calendar year and at the \nend of the calendar year as follows: \nCY Unearned Exposures = CY Written Exposures \u2013 CY Earned Exposures + Unearned Exposures as of \nthe beginning of CY. \nIn-force exposures are the number of insured units that are exposed to having a claim at a given point in \ntime.  In other words, they represent the exposure to loss as a snapshot in time with no consideration for \nthe duration of the exposure.  The in-force exposure as of June 15, 2011, is the sum of insured units that \nhave an inception date on or before June 15, 2011, and an expiration date after June 15, 2011.  Not all \ninsurance companies define \u201cinsured unit\u201d the same way.  Most companies define insured units to be the \ncount of items exposed to loss at a given point in time.  For example, if an automobile policy insures three \ncars, that one policy could contribute three in-force exposures at a given point in time.  Alternatively, \nsome companies may define insured unit in terms of the number of policies (the auto example above \nwould have one in-force exposure under this definition) or the written exposures (in the auto example, \nthere could be three in-force exposures if the term is annual, or 1.5 in-force exposures if the term is semi-\nannual).   \nA vertical line drawn at the valuation date will intersect the policies that are in-force on that date.
