The International Actuarial Association (IAA) strongly believes that \nentity-specific data is far preferred over external data. There is a risk that external data may be \nmisleading or irrelevant due to differences relating to: insurance products, case outstanding and \nsettlement practices, insurers\u2019 operations, coding, geographic areas, and mix of business and \nproduct types. Thus, the actuary must carefully evaluate the relevance and value of external \ndata.12  \n \n \nHomogeneity and Credibility of Data13 \n \nDifferent lines of insurance exhibit different claim behaviors. For example, claims from insurance \npolicies sold to businesses generally do not have the same characteristics as claims from \ninsurance policies sold to individuals, even when the insurance coverages are identical. Likewise, \nclaims for umbrella and excess insurance are different from claims for primary insurance. Even \nwithin a single line of insurance, the characteristics of claims by subcoverage can differ \nsignificantly. For example, claims involving only property damage for automobile liability \npolicies are generally reported and paid very quickly and have a relatively low severity (i.e., \naverage settlement value). On the other hand, claims arising from automobile accidents involving \ncatastrophic spinal injuries may take years to settle in some jurisdictions and could ultimately cost \nmillions of dollars.  \n \nIt is often possible to improve the accuracy of estimating unpaid claims by subdividing \nexperience into groups exhibiting similar characteristics, such as comparable claim experience \npatterns, settlement patterns, or size of claim distributions.
