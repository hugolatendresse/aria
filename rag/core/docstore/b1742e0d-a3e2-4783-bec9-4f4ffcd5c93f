By creating distinct boundaries, there will be a discontinuity at the boundary.  If there are too \nfew clusters, there may be a significant jump in estimated risk between two adjacent clusters, which is \nundesirable.  Thus, the actuary should select the number of clusters that minimizes noise without creating \nsignificant discontinuities.  Interestingly, many companies have eliminated the grouping of units into \nterritories and simply derive rate relativities for each geographic unit; practically speaking, that is no \ndifferent than creating a significant number of small territories.  If done properly, this minimizes extreme \ndiscontinuities between units.  Ultimately, rather than having rating territories, many companies will geo-\ncode every risk, and the latitude and longitude of the insured item will create a unique rate relativity that \nchanges gradually from one location to a neighboring location. \nCalculating\tTerritorial\tRelativities\t\nOnce the boundary definitions have been determined, the actuary determines the associated rate \nrelativities or differentials.  This can be accomplished using the techniques described in the prior two", "type": "Document"}}
