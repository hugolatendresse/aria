This example has \nbeen addressed in each of the preceding chapters of Part 3. We know, based on interviews with \nmanagement of XYZ Insurer and reviews of the diagnostic development triangles, that there have \nbeen significant changes in both their internal and external environments. (It may be valuable to \nreview the diagnostic triangles presented in Chapter 6 for XYZ Insurer.) The only adjustment we \nmake to the severity methodology to reflect these recent changes is in our selection of the \ndevelopment factors. We select the volume-weighted average of the age-to-age factors for the \nlatest two years; we use the latest two years in an attempt to reflect the most recent operating \nenvironment at XYZ Insurer. \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheet 3, we project the ultimate number of claims based on closed and reported \nclaim counts. While the two projections of claim counts are somewhat close for accident years \n1998 through 2005, we observe significant differences in the projected number of ultimate claims \nfor 2006 through 2008. For every year starting in 2000 through 2008, the ultimate count \nprojections based on closed counts are greater than the ultimate projections based on reported \ncounts. \n \nSimilar to the previous collision example, the next step is to project the ultimate severities by \naccident year. We analyze the triangle of reported severities in Exhibit II, Sheet 5. We observe \nthat within the triangle of age-to-age factors, the latest point in each column is usually the lowest \npoint in the column. This is consistent with management\u2019s assertion that there has been a \nsignificant increase in case outstanding strength, particularly in calendar year 2007. Again, we \nuse the latest two years for our selected development factors in an attempt to best reflect the \ncurrent environment at this insurer.", "type": "Document"}}
