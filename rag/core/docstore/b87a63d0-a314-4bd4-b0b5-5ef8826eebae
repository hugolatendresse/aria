The criteria can be grouped into \nthe following categories: \n\uf0b7 Statistical \n\uf0b7 Operational \n\uf0b7 Social \n\uf0b7 Legal \n \nStatistical\tCriteria\t\nThe rating variables should reflect the variation in expected costs among different groups of insureds.  \nIdeally, the company will have collected or can obtain data that enables it to test the statistical \neffectiveness of the rating variable being considered.28  If so, the company should consider the following \nstatistical criteria to help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the potential rating variable:   \n\uf0b7 Statistical significance \n\uf0b7 Homogeneity \n\uf0b7 Credibility \n \nThe rating variable should be a statistically significant risk differentiator.  In other words, the expected \ncost estimates should vary for the different levels of the rating variable, the estimated differences should \nbe within an acceptable level of statistical confidence, and the estimated differences should be relatively \nstable from one year to the next.  If all the levels for a given rating variable have no statistical variation in \nloss experience, then the rating variable may not be useful.  If instead the estimates of cost differences are \ndifferent but the results are volatile, then it is less clear whether the rating variable is improving equity or \nnot.     \nSecond, the levels of a rating variable should represent distinct groups of risks with similar expected \ncosts.  In other words, the groups should be defined such that the risk potential is homogeneous within \ngroups and heterogeneous between groups.  If a group of insureds contains materially different risks, then \nthe risks should be subdivided further by creating more levels of an existing rating variable or by", "type": "Document"}}
