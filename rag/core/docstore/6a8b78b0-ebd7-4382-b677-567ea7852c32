However, reported \nclaims shown in Column (7) represent the incremental reported value during the period of time \nrunning from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Reported claims over the year are equal to \nsum of the payments during the year (Column (5)) and the changes in case outstanding  \n(Column (6)). \n \nThe transactions presented in Table 2 vary with respect to the impact on total reported claims. In \nthe first two examples, there are payments made in 2008 on claims where there was no prior \nexisting case outstanding at December 31, 2007; thus total reported claims for both of these claims \nincrease. Such payments could occur when the insurer reopens a claim. In a situation where the \npayment made during the year is offset by an equal reduction in the case outstanding, there is no \nchange to reported claim (Example Number 4). If the payment is larger than the reduction in case \noutstanding, then the reported claim will increase (Example Number 6). If the payment is smaller \nthan the reduction in case outstanding, then the reported claim will decrease (Examples Number 5 \nand 7). A change in case outstanding without any associated payment will also impact the reported \nclaim (Examples Number 3 and 9). \n \nWhile the reported claims in the interval can be positive or negative, the reported claims at a point \nin time are rarely negative. Remember that we define the reported claims at a point in time to \nequal cumulative payments plus case outstanding at that point in time.  \n25", "type": "Document"}}
