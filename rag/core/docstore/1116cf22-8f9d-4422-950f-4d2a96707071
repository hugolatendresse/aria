Ultimate claims are the \nsum of three components: cumulative paid claims, case outstanding, and IBNR. The relationships \namong these three components vary tremendously by line of insurance, by jurisdiction, and by \ntime interval being reviewed (e.g., recent accident years versus mature accident years). The \nrelationships also vary from insurer to insurer depending on the insurers\u2019 claims management \nphilosophies and procedures.  \n \nPaid claims and case outstanding typically represent a high proportion of ultimate claims at early \nmaturities for lines of insurance such as automobile physical damage and property. These lines of \ninsurance are characterized as short-tail lines of insurance due to the short period of time \nassociated with the claims reporting and settlement processes. In contrast, medical malpractice \noccurrence is an example of a line of insurance that is classified in the U.S. as a long-tail line of \ninsurance due to the lengthy period of time associated with the reporting and settlement of these \ntypes of claims. U.S. workers compensation and general liability, including products liability and \nerrors and omissions, are other examples of long-tail lines of insurance in the U.S. \n \nIn the four pie charts on the following page, we compare the split between paid claims, case \noutstanding, and IBNR for accident years 2006 and 2007 as of December 31, 2007,33 for the \nconsolidated U.S. industry data for automobile physical damage and for medical malpractice \noccurrence.34 While the examples refer to specific U.S. coverages, the intent of the pie charts is to \ndemonstrate the significant differences in the proportions between paid, case outstanding, and \nIBNR for different accident years, and the differences between short-tail lines and long-tail lines \nof coverage.", "type": "Document"}}
