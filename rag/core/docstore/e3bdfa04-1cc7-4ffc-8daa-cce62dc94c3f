Note, that \naccident half-year 2008-1, which represents the period from January 1, 2008 through June 30, \n2008, is six months old as of June 30, 2008; and accident half-year 2007-2, which represents the \nperiod from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, is 12 months old at June 30, 2008. (We begin \ncounting with the beginning of the accident half-year period.)  \n \nExhibit I, Sheet 3, where we project the claim counts to ultimate, is similar to the development \nprojections contained in preceding chapters. We present the age of the accident half-year in \nColumn (2) of Exhibit I, Sheet 3. Columns (3) and (4) show closed and reported claim counts, \nrespectively, as of June 30, 2008. The next two columns are the development factors to ultimate. \nThe projected ultimate claim counts based on closed counts are shown in Column (7), and the \nprojected ultimate claim counts based on the reported counts are in Column (8). It is obvious after \na quick examination of Columns (7) and (8) that the two projection methods produce similar \nresults for all accident half-years except for the latest period (i.e., 2008-1). \n \nWe now return to the claim count triangles to determine if there is something taking place that we \nmissed upon our first review. One quick way to look for changes or patterns in the triangular data \nis to use a development diagnostic. In Exhibit I, Sheet 4, we present the ratio of closed-to-\nreported claim counts. Looking down the column at age six months, we immediately see evidence \nof seasonality in the relationship between closed and reported counts. For accident half-years \nending with a 2 (i.e., July 1 through December 31), the average ratio of closed-to-reported counts \nis 0.71, and there is minimal variability from period to period around this average. Similarly, \nthere is minimal variability in the ratio of closed-to-reported claim counts for accident half-years", "type": "Document"}}
