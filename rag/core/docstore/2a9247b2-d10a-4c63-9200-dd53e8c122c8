Different insurers, TPAs, IAs, or \neven different departments within the same organization may use the same term to mean different \nthings. The actuary must know the true meaning of the types of claims data contained in the \ninsurer\u2019s claims reports and information systems.  \n \n\u201cIncurred loss\u201d is an example of a term that the actuary may initially assume is used fairly \nconsistently throughout the insurance industry. Upon closer examination, however, we see that \nincurred losses means different things to different people. To someone in the finance department, \nincurred losses usually refer to the transactional losses incurred during a defined period, usually a \ncalendar (or fiscal) quarter or year. Thus, the incurred losses to someone in finance usually refer \nto the sum of payments made during the time period plus the change in total unpaid claims. \nFurthermore, finance departments usually include IBNR in their definition of incurred loss. To an \nactuary wanting to build an incurred claim development triangle, incurred losses are typically the \ncumulative claim payments through a valuation date plus the case outstanding at the same \nvaluation date.17 Some actuaries refer to these losses as case incurred or incurred on reported \nclaims. We have also seen the term incurred losses used in TPA loss reports to refer to case \noutstanding only. To avoid any confusion, we use the term \u201creported claims\u201d throughout this \nbook to refer to case incurred losses. (Cumulative and incremental reported claims are introduced \nin Chapter 2 and are explored further in Chapter 5.)  \n \nThe terms \u201cunpaid claims\u201d and \u201creserves\u201d are other examples of terminology that have many", "type": "Document"}}
