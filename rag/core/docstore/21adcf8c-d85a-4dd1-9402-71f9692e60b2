Of course, the true relativities are not known for \neach rating variable.

If a company fails to charge appropriate rates at the \nindividual risk level when other companies are doing so, their lower-risk insureds are likely to leave and \ninsure with other companies that are charging lower rates.  If not addressed, the company can be \nsubjected to adverse selection.   \nFor most lines of business, it is not feasible to set rates on a risk-by-risk basis, so companies attempt to \nidentify characteristics that can be used as rating variables to subdivide the insured population into more \nhomogeneous, but still credible, groups for the purposes of rating.  Companies should consider statistical, \noperational, and social criteria, and review applicable laws and statutes when deciding whether or not to \nuse a certain characteristic as a rating variable.  \nOnce the company determines the risk characteristics that will be used as rating variables, the company \ncan perform univariate pure premium, loss ratio, or adjusted pure premium analysis to determine the", "type": "Document"}}
