Such an evaluation leads to a distribution of costs to each of the lags of a mature claims-\nmade policy.  \nAs an example, consider the mature claims-made policy from 2015 displayed in Table 16.7 above.  Loss \nestimates for L(2015,0), L(2015,1), L(2015,2), L(2015,3) and L(2015,4) expressed as a ratio to the total \nlosses for Report Year 2015 can be used to determine the step factors.  The cumulative values of these \nratios by year of lag are used to determine the step structure.  The table below shows a potential step \nfactor structure for a claims-made policy.   \n16.8 Step  Factors\nClaims-Made Year Step Factor\nFirst 40%\nSecond 70%\nThird 85%\nFourth 95%\nFifth or More 100%  \nThe table implies that 40% of the costs of a mature claims-made policy come from claims that occurred \nand were reported during that year, 70% of the costs come from claims that occurred during that year and \none year prior, and so on.  The progression continues until the mature stage is reached. \nThere is a similar coordination issue when switching from claims-made coverage to an occurrence policy.  \nConsider the example of an insured switching from a claims-made policy to an occurrence policy in 2011. \n \nThis situation creates a coverage gap.  More specifically, there is no coverage for claims that occurred \nbefore 2011, but were not reported until after the expiration of the last claims-made policy.  To address \nthis issue, companies offer an extended reporting endorsement (or tail coverage) that covers claims that \noccurred but were not reported before the expiration of the last claims-made policy. \n16.9 Sw itch from Claims-M ad e to Occurrence Policy\n01234\n2010 L(2010,0) L(2010,1) L(2010,2) L(2010,3) L(2010,4)\n2011 L(2011,0) L(2011,1) L(2011,2) L(2011,3) L(2011,4)\n2012 L(2012,0) L(2012,1) L(2012,2) L(2012,3) L(2012,4)\n2013 L(2013,0) L(2013,1) L(2013,2) L(2013,3) L(2013,4)\n2014 L(2014,0) L(2014,1) L(2014,2) L(2014,3) L(2014,4)\n2015 L(2015,0) L(2015,1) L(2015,2) L(2015,3) L(2015,4)", "type": "Document"}}
