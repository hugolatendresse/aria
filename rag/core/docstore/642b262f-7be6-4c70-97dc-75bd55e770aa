Brian in \nthe Insurance Accounting and Statistical Association Proceedings. Brian suggested breaking the \nULAE process into five kinds of transactions: \n \n\uf0b7 Setting up new claims \n\uf0b7 Maintaining outstanding claims \n\uf0b7 Making a single payment \n\uf0b7 Closing a claim \n\uf0b7 Reopening a claim \n \nIn the Brian technique, the actuary projects the future number of each type of transaction. Brian \nestimated that each of these transactions would carry a similar cost, and suggested estimating the \ncost per transaction using ratios of historical ULAE expenditures to the number of claim \ntransactions occurring during the same calendar periods.  \n \nThe primary assumption of this technique, which Conger and Nolibos identify as a weakness is \nthat each of the five kinds of claims transactions requires similar ULAE resources and \nexpenditures. The weakness of this assumption could easily be remedied by refining the formula \nto allow for different costs for the different types of transactions. A more significant weakness of \nthis technique is the practical difficulty in estimating both the number of future transactions and \nthe average cost of each transaction. Data supporting these projections (reliable and consistent \nclaim count and claim transaction data) is often not readily available. \n \n \nWendy Johnson Technique \n \nIn her paper \u201cDetermination of Outstanding Liabilities for Unallocated Loss Adjustment \nExpenses,\u201d106 Wendy Johnson follows a similar approach to Brian\u2019s but focuses on two key", "type": "Document"}}
