The \nfollowing graph shows the effect of the rating variable vehicle symbol on claim frequency for the claim \ntype personal auto collision.  This rating variable has seventeen discrete levels, and each level\u2019s exposure \ncount is represented by the yellow bars (the right y-axis).  Each symbol represents a group of vehicles that \nhave been combined based on common characteristics (e.g., weight, number of cylinders, horsepower, \ncost).  Note that in addition to discrete variables (also known as categorical factors), GLMs can also \naccommodate numeric fields as continuous variables (referred to as variates).  Variates can take the form \nof polynomials or splines34 within GLMs. \n10.1 Effect of Vehicle Symbol on Automobile Collision Frequency \n \nThis output is from a multiplicative model.  The base level, to which all other levels\u2019 parameter estimates \nwill be expressed relative, is vehicle symbol 4.  Consequently, its multiplicative differential is 1.00.  The \nbase level is typically chosen as one with a fairly large, if not the largest, volume of exposure.  This \nensures statistical diagnostics are expressed relative to something large and presumably stable.  The GLM \noutput is shown as the green line with circle markers.
