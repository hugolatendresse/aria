The period of time for data aggregation is defined by both an \naccounting period and a valuation date.  The accounting period refers to the inventory of losses during a \nparticular time, which is often consistent with financial statement dates\u2014e.g., month, quarter, or calendar \nyear.  The valuation date, which can be different than the end of the accounting period, is the date as of \nwhich the losses are evaluated for analysis.  It is often expressed as the number of months after the start of \nthe accounting period (e.g., Accident Year 2010 as of 18 months implies Accident Year 2010 as of June \n30, 2011).  The valuation date can also be expressed relative to the end of the accounting period (e.g., six \nmonths after the close of Accident Year 2010).  As valuation dates can occur prior to the end of the \naccounting period, the former approach is more common.  \nLOSS\tDATA\tAGGREGATION\tMETHODS\t\nAs described in Chapter 3, four common methods of data aggregation are calendar year, accident year, \npolicy year, and report year.  The following summarizes each method as it pertains to aggregation of \nlosses. \nCalendar year aggregation considers all loss transactions that occur during the twelve-month calendar \nyear without regard to the date of policy issuance, the accident date, or the report date of the claim.  \nCalendar year paid losses include all payments made during the calendar year on any claims.  Calendar \nyear reported losses are equal to paid losses plus the change in case reserves during that twelve-month \ncalendar year.  At the end of the calendar year, all calendar year paid and reported losses are fixed. \nAccident year aggregation considers all loss transactions for claims that have an occurrence date during", "type": "Document"}}
