These changes need not even be internal to the \ncompany. For example, changes in the waiting periods, statutes of limitation, and no-fault \ncoverage can have a significant effect on the meaning of a \u2018claim\u2019 and thus on ultimate \nseverity.\u201d68 \n \nThese methods also rely on the mix of claims to be relatively consistent. For example, if an \nunusually stormy season results in numerous but minor slip-and-fall accidents, then a general \nliability insurer may see a significant increase in claim counts but at significantly lower average \nvalues than typically seen at that accident year maturity. This will distort a frequency-severity \nanalysis unless an adjustment is made for the change in the mix of claim types or claim causes. \n \n \nEnhancements for Frequency-Severity Techniques \n \nWe already address the importance of seasonality in one of the examples presented earlier in this \nchapter. The actuary should consider the influence of seasonality on both the frequency and the \nseverity of claims. We also discuss the influence of inflation on both the number of claims and \nthe average value of claims. Our discussions of trend with respect to the frequency-severity \nprojection methods are intended to be an introduction to the topic only. There is a considerable \nbody of literature within the actuarial community that addresses the topic of trend. We \nrecommend that the actuary further his or her knowledge on this important topic and incorporate \nmore sophisticated trending analyses into the frequency-severity techniques presented in this \nchapter. \n \nAs we note previously in this chapter (and other chapters), it is important to understand the data", "type": "Document"}}
