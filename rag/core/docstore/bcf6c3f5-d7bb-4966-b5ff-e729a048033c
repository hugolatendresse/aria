The first rate level group is assigned the rate level of 1.00.  The cumulative rate level index of \neach subsequent group is the prior group\u2019s cumulative rate level index multiplied by the rate level for that \ngroup.  For example, the cumulative rate level index for the second rate level group is 1.05 (= 1.00 x \n1.05).  The third rate level group\u2019s cumulative rate level index is 1.155 (= 1.05 x 1.10).  The following \ntable shows the cumulative rate level indices for each group in our example. \n \nStep 4, the calculation of the average rate level index for each year, is the weighted average of the \ncumulative rate level indices in Step 3, using the areas calculated in Step 2 as weights.  For example, the \naverage rate level index for Calendar Year 2011 is: \n0.500. x 1.1550  0.375 x 1.0500  0.125 x 1.000  1.0963 \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\n \n \nStep 5 is the calculation of the on-level factor, defined as follows: \n.Period  Historicalfor  Index    Level  Rate  Average\nIndex  Level  Rate  CumulativeCurrent    Period  Historicalfor  Factor    Level-On \uf03d  \nThe numerator considers the most recent cumulative rate level index (i.e., not just the most recent within \nthe historical experience period) from Step 3.
