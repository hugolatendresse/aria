If a company takes a rate decrease, the \nexpectation is that the close and retention ratios will improve; similarly, a rate increase will generally lead \nto reductions in these ratios.  (Note these changes may be neutralized if competitors are making similar \nchanges.) \nCharts 13.10 and 13.11 are typical charts comparing close ratios and retention by month (x-axis).  The \nbars represent the number of applicants or renewals (right y-axis) for each month.  The line represents the \nclose or retention ratio (left y-axis) for each month.  The increase in each ratio over the last couple months \ncoincides with a rate decrease implemented in July.", "type": "Document"}}
