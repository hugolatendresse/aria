Understanding \nthe insurer\u2019s reinsurance program may be dictated by statute.16  \n \nCurrent and previous reinsurance plans and retentions directly affect an insurer\u2019s estimates of \nunpaid claims. Therefore, the actuary may need to analyze claims both gross and net of \nreinsurance recoveries (i.e., both before and after taking into account the reinsurance recoveries). \nSome actuaries separately analyze gross claims and ceded claims (i.e., claims ceded to reinsurers) \nand then determine the estimate of net unpaid claims as the difference between estimated gross \nunpaid claims and estimated ceded unpaid claims. Other actuaries separately analyze gross claims \nand net claims (i.e., gross claims minus claims ceded to reinsurers) and then determine the \nestimate of ceded unpaid claims as the difference between estimated gross unpaid claims and \nestimated net unpaid claims. In either situation, the actuary must review the implied net or ceded \nunpaid claim estimate for reasonableness. For insurers who do not cede claims to a reinsurer, \nthere is no difference between claims net and gross of reinsurance, and in these situations separate \nanalyses are not necessary. \n \nOne area that requires the actuary\u2019s close attention is the treatment of ALAE in excess of loss \nreinsurance contracts. Generally, there are three possible treatments of ALAE: \n \n\uf0be Included with the claim amount in determining excess of loss coverage (which is the most \ncommon treatment today) \n \n\uf0be Not included in the coverage \n \n\uf0be Included on a pro rata basis; the ratio of the excess portion of the claim to the total claim \namount determines coverage for ALAE", "type": "Document"}}
