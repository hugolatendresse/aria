Consequently, a gross sales figure is used as \nthe exposure base for products liability insurance as it is a reasonable and practical proxy for products in \nuse.  Of course, gross sales will be a better proxy for a consumable good that is only in use for a short \nperiod of time (e.g., a cup of coffee) than a durable good that will be used for many years (e.g., a \nlawnmower). \nHistorical\tPrecedence\t\nOver time, the industry may discover a more accurate or practical exposure base than the one currently in \nuse (e.g., the example of miles driven discussed in the previous section).  While the advantages may be \nclear, any change in an exposure base should be very carefully considered prior to implementation for \nseveral reasons.  First, any change in exposure base can lead to large premium swings for individual \ninsureds.  Second, a change in exposure base will require a change in the rating algorithm, which \ndepending on the unique circumstances, may require a significant effort to adjust the rating systems, \nmanuals, etc.  Third, ratemaking analysis is normally based on several years of data.  A change in \nexposure base may necessitate significant data adjustments for future analyses.   \nWorkers compensation has historically used payroll as an exposure base.  In the 1980s, there was a lot of \npressure to change the exposure base to hours worked for medical coverage in order to correct perceived \ninadequacies of the exposure base for union companies with higher pay scales.  Although hours worked \nmade intuitive sense, the exposure base was not changed at that time, and one of the major reasons cited", "type": "Document"}}
