The dynamics of this interaction will frequently vary based on whether the \nactuary is an employee of the insurer or an outside consultant. For example, while an actuarial \nemployee may be able to just call or walk over to meet those involved in the insurer\u2019s claims \noperation when a question arises, a consultant may have to go through a more formal process, \nsuch as scheduling a meeting with company management involved in the relevant processes. To \nsimplify the discussion, this chapter is written predominately from the perspective of an outside \nconsultant, using the term management when referring to discussions with those involved in the \nunderlying claims and underwriting processes. \n \n \nUnderstanding the Environment \n \nBefore applying mathematical models to develop estimates of unpaid claims for an insurer, the \nactuary must first understand the dynamics of the environment in which the insurer operates. This \nincludes both the specific circumstances existing within the insurer\u2019s organization as well as the \neconomic, social, legal, and regulatory environments that will also affect the liabilities of the \ninsurer. Without a sound understanding of the environment, both internal and external to the \ninsurer, an actuary may not be able to correctly interpret patterns and changes in the data.  \n \nThere are countless changes that influence the claims experience of an insurer. Claims reporting \nand payment patterns, frequency, and severity can all be altered by changes in: \n \n\uf0be Classes of business written or geographical focus \n \n\uf0be Policy provisions such as policy limits and deductibles \n \n\uf0be Reinsurance arrangements including limits and attachment points \n \n\uf0be Claims management philosophy that often occur when managerial changes occur", "type": "Document"}}
