When used, it is most often due to the absence of other reliable \nclaims data for the purpose of developing an unpaid claim estimate.  \n \n \nMechanics of the Method \n \nIn our Self-Insurer Case Only example, there is no available data for historical paid claims. \nTherefore, we are not able to create paid or reported claim development triangles based on the \nself-insurer\u2019s own experience. Instead we rely on insurance industry benchmark development \npatterns to project the general liability case outstanding values that are available. One important \ndifference between the development technique applied to case outstanding and the development \ntechnique applied to reported claims and paid claims is that the projected values are estimates of \nunpaid claims and not ultimate claims.  \n \n268", "type": "Document"}}
