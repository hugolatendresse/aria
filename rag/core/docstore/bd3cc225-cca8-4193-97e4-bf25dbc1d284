There are two forces at play in this scenario. First, the reported claims are \ngreater along the latest diagonal due to the increase in case outstanding adequacy. Second, the \nage-to-age factors are also higher along the latest two diagonals where the insurer strengthened \nthe adequacy of the case outstanding. Unless the actuary mechanically or judgmentally adjusts for \nsuch change, an increase in case outstanding adequacy can lead to higher cumulative claim \ndevelopment factors. (We will discuss some methods that the actuary could use for such \nadjustments in Chapter 13.) We are then multiplying a higher value of reported claims by a higher \ncumulative claim development factor. The result is a projected value of ultimate claims that likely \noverstates the estimate of total unpaid claims.  \n \nLooking back at the underlying assumptions of the development technique, we recall that the key \nassumption of this technique is that claims reported to date will continue in a similar manner in \nthe future. That is, the development technique assumes that the relative change in a given year\u2019s \nclaims from one evaluation point to the next is similar to the relative change in prior years\u2019 claims \nat similar evaluation points. In times of changing case outstanding adequacy, this assumption no \nlonger holds true for reported claims. Since case outstanding are now more adequate than they \nhave been historically, we actually need a lower CDF-to-ultimate factor not a higher factor. In", "type": "Document"}}
