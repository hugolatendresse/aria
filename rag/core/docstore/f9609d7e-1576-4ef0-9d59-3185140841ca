The current trend period is therefore 2 years.  If the selected current trend is -1%, \nthe factor to adjust Calendar-Accident Year 2011 losses to the average accident date of the latest data \npoint is 0.98 (= (1.0 - 1%)2 ).  Second, these trended losses are projected from the average accident date of \nthe latest data point (the \u201cproject from\u201d date of June 30, 2013) to the average loss occurrence date for the \nforecast period (assuming annual policies, the \u201cproject to\u201d date of December 31, 2015).  The length of this \nprojection period is 2.5 years.  If the loss projection trend selected is 2%, losses trended to current level \nare further adjusted by a factor of 1.05 (= (1.0 + 2%)2.5).
