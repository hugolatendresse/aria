HLDI also \nprovides highly summarized information that can be useful to insurers as well as the general public.  One \nsuch example is information on which make and model cars have the highest incident of auto injury.   \nExamples of other organizations that collect, report, and analyze insurance industry data are the Insurance \nResearch Council (IRC), the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), and the National Insurance \nCrime Bureau (NICB).  A more comprehensive list of aggregated industry data providers is beyond the \nscope of this text.   \nCompetitor\tRate\tFilings/Manuals\t\nDepending on the jurisdiction, competitor rate filings may be available to the public.  For example, U.S. \ncompanies may be required to submit rate filings to the appropriate regulatory body when changing rates \nor rating structures for some insurance products.  Rate filings normally include actuarial justification for \nrequested rate changes and the manual pages needed to rate a policy. \nIn the simplest scenario, the filed rate change may involve a change to base rates only.  Even in this case, \nthe filing may still include helpful information related to overall indicated loss cost levels and trends in \nlosses and expenses.  If, however, the company is making changes to rating variable differentials (e.g., \ndriver age relativities, territorial relativities, amount of insurance relativities), then the filing may also \ninclude information about the indicated relationships between the different levels for each rating variable \nundergoing a change.     \nCompanies may also be required to include the manual pages necessary to rate policies.  As discussed in \nChapter 2, the manual contains the rules, rating structures, and rating algorithms in use by the company.  \nThis information can be analyzed to estimate the overall average premium level charged by the company", "type": "Document"}}
