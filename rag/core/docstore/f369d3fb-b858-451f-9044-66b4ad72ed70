The insurer groups together all claims \nwith accident dates within the particular time period. \n \nVarious financial reporting schedules and statistical organizations for insurers in the U.S. and \nCanada require claim information by accident year. In some areas, such as Lloyds of London, \nfinancial reporting by underwriting year is more common than accident year. \n \nAs indicated previously, actuaries often use calendar year exposures with accident year claims. \nCalendar year earned premiums provide an approximate matching of the claims that occur during \nthe year with the insurance premiums earned by an insurer during the year in which the insurance \ncoverage is effective. We will see below that claims and exposures aggregated by policy year \nprovide an exact match. For self-insurers, however, calendar year exposures do represent an exact \nmatch with the accident year claims. \n40", "type": "Document"}}
