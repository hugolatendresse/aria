The incremental percentage reported for the 12-24 \nmonth period is equal to 90.1% minus 77.4%, or 12.7%.  \n \nWe can also determine an implied payment pattern based on the cumulative paid claim \ndevelopment factors. In the following table, we present the cumulative paid claim development \nfactors and the associated payment patterns (cumulative and incremental) for U.S. Industry Auto. \n \nTable 4 \u2013 Payment Pattern \n \nAge \n(Months) \nCumulative  \nPaid Claim  \nDevelopment Factors \n \nCumulative % \nPaid \n \nIncremental % \nPaid \n12 2.390 41.8% 41.8% \n24 1.404 71.2% 29.4% \n36 1.184 84.5% 13.3% \n48 1.085 92.2% 7.7% \n60 1.040 96.2% 4.0% \n72 1.020 98.0% 1.8% \n84 1.011 98.9% 0.9% \n96 1.006 99.4% 0.5% \n108 1.004 99.6% 0.2% \n120 1.002 99.8% 0.2% \n \nIn the U.S. Industry Auto example, which contains the aggregated results for U.S. private \npassenger automobile liability, we observe that the incremental percentages reported and paid in \neach successive interval are less than or equal to that of the previous age interval. Actuaries often \nobserve such patterns for many lines of P&C insurance, consistent with reasonable expectations \nfor the underlying process of settling a portfolio of claims. Where the underlying development \npatterns are erratic, actuaries frequently incorporate increased levels of actuarial judgment into \nthe selection process to achieve claim development patterns that exhibit such a steady, decreasing \npattern. \n \nIt is worthwhile to note that while the above payment and reporting patterns might serve as a \nreasonable model for the expected payment and reporting of future claims, the development \nmethod implies somewhat different patterns for each of the accident years from 1998 through \n2007. This is due to the fact that the emerged portion of each accident year does not precisely fit \nthe selected age-to-age factors.", "type": "Document"}}
