If the \nclosed counts exclude CNP counts but reported counts include the CNP counts, the actuary will \nnot be able to use both the closed and reported counts to produce comparable estimates of the \nultimate number of claims. If claims include all claim adjustment expense (with or without claim \npayments or case outstanding) but counts do not include claims with claim adjustment expense \nonly, there will not be an appropriate match of the number of claims and the dollars that are spent \non the claims. Another important issue related to the number of claims is claimant count versus \noccurrence count. A single occurrence, such as an automobile accident may result in multiple \ninjured parties or damaged vehicles or both. Does the insurer record one count or multiple counts \nfor such an occurrence? The actuary must understand how the insurer defines and records claim \ncounts and whether or not there have been changes in the insurer\u2019s practices during the \nexperience period. There may also be different practices with respect to recording claim counts \non the insurer\u2019s systems when the payment is below the deductible. As we note continually \nthrough this book, the important point is that the actuary must understand the data that he or she \nis working with. \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheets 1 and 2, we present the development triangles for closed and reported claim \ncounts, respectively. We judgmentally select age-to-age factors based on the simple average for \nthe latest three half-years for both closed and reported counts. At first glance, we note that there is \nvariability from accident half-year to accident half-year at 6-to-12 months for the closed claim \ncounts, but the averages appear relatively close to one another. We will further investigate this \nparticular age-to-age maturity (6-to-12 months) later in this example.", "type": "Document"}}
