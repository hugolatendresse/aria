The claim is reported to the insurance \ncompany on January 15, 2010, and an initial case reserve of $10,000 is established.  An initial \npayment of $1,000 is made on March 1, 2010, with a corresponding $1,000 reduction in the case \nreserve.  A final payment of $9,000 is made on May 1, 2010, and the claim is closed. \n\uf0b7 Policy B:  No claim activity.  \n\uf0b7 Policy C:  A covered loss occurs on October 1, 2010, is reported on October 15, 2010, and a case \nreserve of $18,000 is established.  The insurer makes a payment of $2,000 on December 15, \n2010, and reduces the case reserve to $17,000.  An additional payment of $7,000 is made on \nMarch 1, 2011, and the case reserve is reduced to $15,000.  The claim is closed on March 1, \n2012, when the insurer makes a final payment of $15,000 and receives a $1,000 salvage recovery \nby selling damaged property. \n\uf0b7 Policy C:  A second loss occurs on February 1, 2011.  The claim is reported on February 15, \n2011, and an initial reserve of $15,000 is set.  On December 1, 2011, the company pays a law \nfirm $1,000 for fees related to the handling of the claim.  The claim is closed on that date with no \nloss payments made. \n \nThe claim associated with Policy A generates three separate records:  one when the claim is reported and \nthe initial reserve is set, one when the first payment is made, and one when the last payment is made.  \nThere are no records for Policy B as no claims were reported.  Policy C had two separate claims.  The \nfirst claim generates four records:  one when the claim is reported and the initial reserve is set, and three \nfor the three different dates that payments and reserve adjustments are made.  The second claim generates \na record on the date it is reported and the initial reserve is set and a subsequent record on the date the \nclaim is closed.", "type": "Document"}}
