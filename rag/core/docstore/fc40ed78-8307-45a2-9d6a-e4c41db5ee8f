Mr. Wiser states: \u201cThe reserve \ndevelopment method attempts to analyze the adequacy of case reserves based on the history of \npayments against those case reserves.\u201d In this chapter, we present two accident year examples of \nMr. Wiser\u2019s case outstanding development technique.70  In this chapter, we refer to this technique \nas Approach #1. We also present an example for a self-insurer of the standard development \ntechnique applied to case outstanding in which the case outstanding development factors to ultimate \nare derived from industry-based benchmark reported and paid claim development factors; we refer \nto this example as Approach #2. \n \n \nCase Outstanding Development Technique \u2013 Approach #1 \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nAssumptions for the case outstanding development technique are similar to those for other \ndevelopment techniques described in this book. An additional important assumption is that claims \nactivity related to IBNR is related consistently to claims already reported.  \n \n \nCommon Uses \n \nThe case outstanding development technique is not used extensively by actuaries. The assumption \nthat IBNR claim activity is related to claims already reported (i.e., development on known claims \nversus pure IBNR) limits its use. In other words, this method is appropriate when applied to lines \nof insurance for which most of the claims are reported in the first accident period. It is this \nrequirement that makes the case outstanding development method so strong for claims-made \ncoverages and report year analysis because the claims for a given accident year are known at the \nend of the accident year.  \n \n \nMechanics of the Method", "type": "Document"}}
