We also note that Claim ID 3 did not have \nany payments as of December 31, 2005. Thus, the $600 paid claims which appear in the first cell of \nthe triangle represent payments for Claim IDs 1 and 2 during the year 2005. \n \nWe now construct the second diagonal of the cumulative paid claim triangle; this is the \nDecember 31, 2006 valuation. The second diagonal of the triangle contains two points: accident \nyear 2005 at 24 months and accident year 2006 at 12 months. Continuing along the first row, we \nfirst calculate the value of paid claims at 24 months for accident year 2005. Total payments made \nduring 2006 for Claim IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are $620 ($220 + $200 + $200 + $0). Cumulative claim \npayments for accident year 2005 through December 31, 2006 are equal to the sum of the \npayments made during 2005 and the payments made during 2006 for a total of $1,220. \n \nThe second point along the December 31, 2006 diagonal is accident year 2006 at 12 months. In \nthe table we observe three claims with 2006 accident dates. However, only Claim IDs 5 and 6 \nwere reported in 2006. Thus, we do not include Claim ID 7 in the calculation for the \nDecember 31, 2006 valuation24. The paid claims for accident year 2006 as of December 31, 2006 \nare equal to the sum of claim payments ($260 + $200) for Claim IDs 5 and 6.  \n \nOur example continues with the third diagonal, the December 31, 2007 valuation, which is also \nknown as the 2007 diagonal. The third diagonal consists of three points: \n \n\uf0be Accident year 2005 at 36 months \n\uf0be Accident year 2006 at 24 months \n\uf0be Accident year 2007 at 12 months \n \nWe follow a similar procedure of cumulating claim payments made through December 31, 2007. \nFor accident year 2005, there are additional claim payments of $300 made during 2007. Thus, \ncumulative claim payments for accident year 2005 as of December 31, 2007 are $1,520. For", "type": "Document"}}
