The importance of this figure is that it is the amount of the total premium that the company has not \nyet earned and the insured is entitled to get back in the event of a cancellation (subject to short rate table \nadjustments).  At any time during the life of the policy, the written premium is simply the sum of the \nearned premium and unearned premium as shown in this formula: \nPremium.  Unearned Premium Earned  PremiumWritten \uf02b\uf03d  \nFor aggregating premium across groups of policies, the formula depends on the method of data \naggregation.  Policy year aggregation would follow the formula immediately above.  Calendar year \naggregation, however, would need to consider the unearned premium at the beginning of the calendar \nyear and at the end of the calendar year as follows: \nCY Unearned Premium = CY Written Premium \u2013 CY Earned Premium + Unearned Premium as of the \nbeginning of the CY. \nIn-force premium is the total amount of full-term premium for all policies in effect at a given date.  \nMore specifically, the in-force premium as of June 15, 2011, is the sum of full-term premium for all \npolicies that have an inception date on or before June 15, 2011, and an expiration date on or after June 15, \n2011.  A vertical line drawn at the valuation date will intersect the policies that are in-force on that date.  \nAs can be seen in Figure 5.13, Policies A, B, and C are all in effect on June 15, 2011, and each \ncontributes to the total in-force premium as of that date. \n \nThe following chart shows the in-force premium for a few example dates:  \n \n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D E F\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n5.13 In-Force Premium\n6/15/11\n5.14 In-force Premium by Date\nPolicy\nEffective \nDate\nExpiration \nDate Premium\nAs of \n1/1/11\nAs of \n6/15/11\nAs of \n1/1/12\nA1 0 / 0 1 / 1 0 0 9 / 3 0 / 1 1 2 0 0 . 0 0$    200.00 $    200.00 $    - $", "type": "Document"}}
