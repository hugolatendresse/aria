The historical fixed expense ratios are based on written or earned premium during \nthe historical period.  To the extent that rate increases (or decreases) were implemented during or after the \nhistorical period, the procedure will tend to overstate (or understate) the expected fixed expenses.  The \nmateriality of the distortion depends on the magnitude of rate changes not fully reflected in the historical \npremium.  Also, utilizing three-year historical expense ratios increases the chances of rate changes not \nbeing fully reflected in the historical premium.  One potential solution to correct this distortion in expense \nratios is to restate the historical written or earned premium at current rate level, as was discussed in \nChapter 5.   \nSecond, significant differences in average premium between the historical experience period and the \nprojected period can lead to an excessive or inadequate overall rate level indication.  Again, the historical \nexpenses are divided by the written or earned premium during that time period.  To the extent that there \nhave been distributional shifts that have increased the average premium (e.g., shifts to higher amounts of \ninsurance) or decreased the average premium (e.g., shifts to higher deductibles) without affecting the \nunderwriting expenses, this methodology will tend to overstate or understate the estimated fixed expense \nratios, respectively.  Interestingly, sometimes the distributional shift can affect both the average premium \nand average expense levels.  For example, a company may incur additional expense by inspecting homes \nupon renewal; this may also increase the average premium level as inspections may cause the company to \nincrease the amount of insurance required on the home.
