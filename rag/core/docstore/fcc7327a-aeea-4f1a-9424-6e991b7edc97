Incremental claim counts in the column labeled 12 represent counts that are closed in the \nfirst 12 months from the start of the accident year. Incremental claim counts in the column \nlabeled 24 represent the counts that are closed in the period between 12 months and 24 months. \nThe rest of the triangle follows a similar naming pattern. (We use similar labeling in the triangle \nof incremental paid claims and incremental paid severities that are presented later in this chapter.) \n \nWe calculate the top left part of the \u201ccompleted square\u201d based on the differences between \nsuccessive columns of the cumulative closed claim count triangle. This part of the completed \nsquare is simply the incremental closed claim count triangle based on the actual experience for \nGL Insurer. To calculate the bottom-right, highlighted part of the incremental closed claim count \nsquare, we first adjust the cumulative closed claim counts at the latest valuation to an ultimate \nbasis and then apply the selected disposal rates for each age interval. \n \nFor example, for accident year x at age y, we calculate projected incremental closed claim counts \nas follows:  \n \n[(ultimate claim counts for accident year x \u2013 cumulative closed claim counts for \naccident year x along latest diagonal) / (1.00 \u2013 selected disposal rate at maturity \nof latest diagonal)] x [disposal rate at y \u2013 disposal rate at y-12] \n \nFor example, the estimated incremental closed claim counts for accident year 2008 at 24 months \nare equal to:", "type": "Document"}}
