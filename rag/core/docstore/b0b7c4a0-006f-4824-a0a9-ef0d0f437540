We present two examples: a self-insurer of U.S. \nworkers compensation (WC Self-Insurer) and XYZ Insurer. As we discuss previously, the claim \ndevelopment factor to ultimate can be highly leveraged for the most recent accident years, which \ncan lead to a greater degree of uncertainty in the estimate of unpaid claims. Therefore, actuaries can \nturn to this type of frequency-severity approach as an alternative method for projecting ultimate \nclaims.  \n \nThis second approach to frequency-severity has five basic steps: \n \n\uf0be Project and select ultimate claim counts \n\uf0be Compare ultimate claim counts to exposures and select frequency \n\uf0be Project ultimate severity \n\uf0be Project ultimate claims \n\uf0be Develop unpaid claim estimate \n \n \nProject and Select Ultimate Claim Counts \n \nSimilar to our examples based on approach #1, we begin with projecting both closed and reported \nclaim counts to an ultimate basis and selecting the ultimate claim counts by accident year (Exhibit \nIII, Sheets 1 through 3).  In this example, we select development factors based on the volume-\nweighted average for the latest five years. For the oldest maturity periods in the closed claim \ncount triangle (84-to-96 months), we judgmentally select a development factor of 1.003, which \nresults in a smoother pattern than the one data point of 1.008. We also judgmentally select a tail \nfactor for closed claim counts of 1.007, which is based on a review of the relationship between \nclosed and reported claim counts at ages of 72, 84, and 96 months. In Exhibit III, Sheet 3, we \nsummarize the projected ultimate claim count projections; the selected ultimate claim counts are \nbased on the average of the two projections, which are very similar for each year.", "type": "Document"}}
