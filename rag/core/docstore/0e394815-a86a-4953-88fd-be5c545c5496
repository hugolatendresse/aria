On the other hand, using losses capped at lower \nlimits may increase the stability of the estimate.  Like the previous complement, the error associated with \nthis complement is generally independent of the error of the base statistic.  \nInsurers generally code losses capped at basic limits for statistical reporting purposes.  Losses capped at \nthe attachment point are generally important for accounting, too.  If some other lower limit is chosen, the \ndata may not be as available.
