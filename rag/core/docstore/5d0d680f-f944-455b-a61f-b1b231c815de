This policyholder will ultimately pay \n$600 (=$400 x 0.5 + $800 x 0.5).  The in-force premium is the full-term premium for the policy that is in-\nforce at that point in time.  So, the in-force premium is $400 for an in-force date between July 1, 2011, \nand December 31, 2011, and $800 for an in-force date between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2012. \nAs in-force premium is the best estimate of the company\u2019s mix of business as of a given date, the most \nrecent in-force premium is often used to measure the impact of a rate change on an existing portfolio of \ncustomers. \nPolicies\tOther\tThan\tAnnual\t\nThe preceding example illustrated premium aggregation techniques assuming all policies are annual.  If \nthe policy terms are not annual, the aggregation concepts are applied the same way.  Since the techniques \nassociated with aggregating calendar year written and earned exposures on semi-annual policies were \ndemonstrated in Chapter 4, they will not be repeated here with respect to premium.   \nActuaries should interpret in-force premium carefully when considering (or comparing) portfolios that \nwrite policies with different terms.  For example, if two insurers write the same volume of written \npremium, but one insurer writes annual term policies and the other writes semi-annual term policies, the \nin-force premium of the insurer writing semi-annual term policies will be half that of the other carrier.  \nAdjustments can be made to make the companies\u2019 in-force numbers more comparable, but this detail is \nbeyond the scope of this text.   \nCalculation\tof\tBlocks\tof\tPolicies\t\nIn reality, companies write many more than six policies; consequently, actuaries often have to perform", "type": "Document"}}
