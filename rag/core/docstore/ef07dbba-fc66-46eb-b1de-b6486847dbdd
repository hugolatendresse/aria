In other words, the claims reported to date contain no \ninformational value as to the amount of claims yet-to-be reported. This is different from the \ndevelopment method where the primary assumption is that unreported (or unpaid) claims will \ndevelop based on reported (or paid) claims to date. \n \nThe reporting and payment patterns used in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods are the same as \nthose selected in the development method. However, the application of the development factors \ndiffers between the two methods. It is also important to note that the expected claims used in the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method using reported claims are the same as those used in the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid claims. \n \n \nCommon Uses of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Technique \n \nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique is most frequently applied to reported and paid claims, yet it \ncan also be used with the number of claims and with ALAE. Actuaries use this technique with all \nlines of insurance including short-tail lines and long-tail lines.
