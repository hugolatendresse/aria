We adjust the initial ultimate claims for each year \nin the experience period through the use of these factors to the cost level for each particular year \nunder examination (i.e., 2004 through 2008). For example, the trend factor of 0.874, which \nappears at the bottom of Column (3), adjusts accident year 2008 claims to the inflation level \nexpected in accident year 2004 (1.03425(2004-2008)). Similarly, the trend factor of 1.070, which \nappears at the top of Column (3), adjusts accident year 2002 claims to the inflation level expected \nin accident year 2004 (1.03425(2004-2002)).  \n \nWe incorporate a second type of adjustment to ultimate claims through the tort reform adjustment \nfactors in Columns (8) through (12). These factors adjust the ultimate claims of each accident \nyear in the experience period to the tort environment of the particular accident year.  \n \nIn addition to adjusting claims, we must adjust earned premiums for rate level changes. In \nChapter 6, we summarize earned premiums and the historical rate level changes for XYZ Insurer. \nIn Columns (14) through (18) we present the on-level factors that adjust the earned premiums \nsummarized in Column (13) to the rate level for the particular accident year. In other words, this \nadjustment restates the premium as if the exposures were written at the rate level that was in \neffect for each particular year. \n \nIn Columns (19) through (23) we present trended and adjusted on-level claim ratios. These claim \nratios equal the initial estimate of ultimate claims multiplied by the trend factors and the tort \nreform adjustment factors divided by the earned premiums adjusted to the appropriate rate level \nfor each year. We examine various averages of the claim ratios by year and select expected claim \nratios in Line (25) of Exhibit III, Sheet 2. \n \n136", "type": "Document"}}
