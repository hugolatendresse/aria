Assuming the insurer wants to \nachieve an expected loss ratio of 70% for both types of risks, an adjustment to the rate is necessary.  \nColumn 8 shows the amount of premium needed to decrease the small risk expected loss ratio to 70%, \nand is calculated by dividing the reported loss by the target loss ratio (to get the needed premium) and \nsubtracting the premium without the loss constant.  The loss constant is calculated by dividing the \npremium shortfall by the number of small risk policies. \nWith more sophisticated multivariate techniques, some insurers are adding a rating variable to account for \nthe size of the risk.  In such cases, the loss constant is no longer necessary.  \nINSURANCE\tTO\tVALUE\t(ITV)\t\nFor many property policies (e.g., homeowners), the policy limit corresponds to the value or replacement \ncost of the insured item, and the rates vary based on the policy limit chosen.  The term insurance to value \n(ITV) is used to indicate how the level of insurance chosen relates to the overall value or replacement cost \nof the item.  For example, if an item is insured to full value, then the amount of insurance equals the total \nvalue or replacement cost of the insured item.  This section discusses the importance of ITV and \naddresses actions companies may take to ensure policies are insured to the appropriate level assumed in \nthe rates. \nInsurance\tto\tValue\tExample\t\nTo help understand the concept and the issues associated with ITV, consider the following example: \n\uf0b7 Two homes worth $250,000 and $200,000 are each insured for the full amount. \n\uf0b7 Expected claim frequency is assumed to be 1% for both homes. \n\uf0b7 Expected losses are uniformly distributed. \nThat information yields the following expected size of loss distributions and rates for each home:", "type": "Document"}}
