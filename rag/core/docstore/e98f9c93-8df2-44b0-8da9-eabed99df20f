In addition, the fee must be adjusted to \naccount for variable underwriting expenses and underwriting profit in the same way that losses and LAE \nper exposure are adjusted for these items in the rate level indication formulae.  In other words, the \ncompany incurs variable expenses and expects target profit on all premium, including that which comes \nfrom fixed expense fees.   \nThe adjustment to the expense fee to account for variable expense and profit is accomplished by dividing \nthe average fixed underwriting expense by the variable permissible loss ratio:   \n .)(1.0 T\nF\nP\nQV\nEA \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d  \nThe following shows the calculation of the proposed expense fee in the simple example:  \n \nIn this example, the proposed $25 additive fee includes $20 to cover the fixed expenses and $5 to cover \nthe variable expense (e.g., premium tax) and profit associated with the $20.  \nSome companies use a fixed per policy expense fee rather than a fixed per exposure expense fee in the \nrating algorithm.  It is important that base rate derivation formulae discussed in the next section combine \naverage variable premium and average flat premium on a consistent basis (i.e., per policy or per \nexposure).  A per policy expense fee can be converted to a per exposure expense fee by dividing by the \naverage number of exposures per policy.   \n14.1 Differentials and  Discounts\nR 1\nCurrent \nDifferential\nIndicated \nDifferential\nCompetitor \nDifferential\nProposed \nDifferential R 2\nCurrent \nDifferential\nIndicated \nDifferential\nCompetitor \nDifferential\nProposed \nDifferential\n10 . 8 0 0 0          0.9000          0.9200         0.9000          A 1.0000             1.0000         1.0000         1.0000", "type": "Document"}}
