Since the assumption is that all policies for a given \nmonth are written on the 15th of the month, the written exposures for annual policies will be earned over a \n13-month calendar period:  1/24 of the exposure will be earned in the second half of the month in which it \nwas written, 1/12 (or 2/24) of the exposure will be earned in each of the next 11 months (i.e., months 2 \nthrough 12), and the final 1/24 of the exposure will be earned in the first half of month 13.  Table 4.24 \nshows the distribution of earned exposures to Calendar Years 2010 and 2011, respectively.  \n \nThough the above examples demonstrate the \u201c15th of the month\u201d rule on calendar year data, the same \nprinciples apply to policy year aggregation. \nEXPOSURE\tTREND\t\nAs will be discussed in several subsequent chapters, the fundamental insurance equation requires that \nincome (premium) equals outgo (loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses), and \ntarget profit during the period in which the rates will be in effect.  The chapters on premium and loss \ndiscuss trending procedures to adjust historical figures to the levels expected in the future.   \nFor some lines of business, the exposure measure used is sensitive to time-related influences such as \ninflation.  For example, payroll and sales revenue are highly influenced by inflationary pressures.  In \nthese lines of business, it may be prudent to measure the trend in historical exposures over time in order to \nproject exposure levels in the future.  These trends can be measured via internal insurance company data \n(e.g., workers compensation payroll) or via industry indices (e.g., average wage index).
