We highlight all other values in the triangle to indicate that they are \nadjusted, not actual values. \n \nBerquist and Sherman then use regression analysis to identify a mathematical formula that \napproximates the relationship between the cumulative number of closed claims (X) and \ncumulative paid claims (Y). Using the automobile BI data, Berquist and Sherman find that a curve \nof the form Y = ae(bX) fits exceptionally well. We conduct the regression analysis for the oldest \nthree accident years. In Exhibit II, Sheet 6, we present the results of this analysis for accident \nyears 1969, 1970, and 1971, including the R-squared value and the estimated a and b values. \n \nSince exponential curves closely approximate the relationship between cumulative closed claim \ncounts and cumulative paid claims, Berquist and Sherman suggest that fitting exponential curves \nfor every pair of two successive points is appropriate as the basis for adjusting paid claims. For \nease of illustration, we reproduce triangles for unadjusted closed claim counts, unadjusted paid \nclaims, and adjusted closed claim counts on the left side of Exhibit II, Sheet 7. We show the \nestimated parameters a and b for all two-point exponential regressions on the right side. For \nexample, the exponential regression for accident year 1969 between ages 12 and 24, such that X = \n(4,079; 6,616) and Y = (1,904; 5,398), would result in a = 356 and b = 0.000411, which we place \nin the age 24 cell. \n \nAfter estimating all parameter values, we can then proceed with adjusting the paid claims. We \nadjust paid claims based on the modifications that we have made to the closed claim count \ntriangle earlier. In general, there are three kinds of treatments: no adjustment, interpolation, and \nextrapolation. Since adjusted closed claim counts are the same as unadjusted closed claim counts", "type": "Document"}}
