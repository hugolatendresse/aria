All 2,324 claims in the first interval have individual \nsizes of loss less than $100,000, so these losses are uncapped.  The other 2,676 claims in the other three \nintervals have individual sizes of loss that exceed $100,000 and are, therefore, capped at $100,000; the \nresulting capped losses for these claims are $267,600,000 (= 2,676 x $100,000).  The sum of those \namounts ($385,229,223 = $117,629,223 + $267,600,000) is divided by the total claim count. \nUsing this technique, the increased limit factor for $250,000 is calculated as follows: \n,046,77$000,5\n000,100$)73680923,1(223,629,117$LAS($100K) \uf03d\uf0b4\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  \n,696,122$000,5\n000,250$)73680(929,599,307$223,629,117$LAS($250K) \uf03d\uf0b4\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  \n.59.1046,77$\n696,122$\nLAS($100K)\nLAS($250K)ILF($250K)  Indicated \uf03d\uf03d\uf03d  \nCensored\tLosses\t\nThe losses used in the example above are uncensored losses.  In other words, the loss data reflected the \nfull amount of the loss assuming no policy limits.  Unfortunately, the data available to the actuary is \ntypically censored at the policy limit; consequently, the actuary does not know the full amount of the loss.  \nFor example, assume an insured with a $50,000 policy limit has an at-fault accident in which the injured \nthird party has $150,000 worth of medical costs.  The claims database will likely only reflect the amount \npaid by the insurer (i.e., $50,000) rather than the amount the claim would be in the absence of any limit \n($150,000).   \nTo further illustrate this point, consider the case that 2,019 of the 5,000 claims in the example above came \nfrom policies with a $100,000 limit.  The uncensored losses for these policies are as follows:", "type": "Document"}}
