Retention ratios are used to gauge the competitiveness of rates and are very \nclosely examined following rate changes or major changes in service.  They are also a key parameter in \nprojecting future premium volume.     \nClose\tRatio\t\t\nThe close ratio (also known as hit ratio, quote-to-close ratio, or conversion rate) is a measure of the rate at \nwhich prospective insureds accept a new business quote.  The close ratio is defined as follows: \n . Quotes ofNumber \nQuotes  Accepted ofNumber   Ratio Close \uf03d   \nFor example, if the company provides 300,000 quotes in a particular month and generates 60,000 new \npolicies from those quotes, then the close ratio is 20% (= 60,000 / 300,000).  Like the retention ratio, \nthere can be significant variation in the way this ratio is defined.  For example, a prospective insured may \nreceive multiple quotes and companies may count that as one quote or may consider each quote \nseparately. \nClose ratios and changes in the close ratios are monitored closely by product management and marketing \ndepartments.  Closed ratios are used to determine the competitiveness of rates for new business.   \nSUMMARY\t\nThis chapter introduces insurance ratemaking, which is unique because the cost of the insurance product \nis not known at the time the product is sold.  The goal of insurance ratemaking is to assure the \nfundamental insurance equation is balanced; in other words, the premium should cover all expected costs \nand should achieve the targeted underwriting profit during the period the rates will be in effect.  Two key \nconsiderations of this goal are that ratemaking is performed on a prospective basis and should ensure that \nthe fundamental insurance equation is balanced both on an overall level as well as at an individual or \nsegment level.  Finally, this chapter outlined basic insurance terms and ratios.", "type": "Document"}}
