This \ndownward spiral will continue until Simple Company improves their rate segmentation, becomes \ninsolvent, or decides to narrow their focus solely to higher-risk insureds and raises rates accordingly.  \nThis process is referred to as adverse selection.  However, the speed and severity of the process depends \non various factors, including whether purchasers of insurance have full and accurate knowledge of \ndifferences in competitor rates and how much price alone influences their purchasing decisions. \nThe adverse selection cycle can be demonstrated by expanding the simple pricing example used in prior \nchapters.  For the purpose of demonstrating adverse selection, the assumptions are as follows: \n\uf0b7 The average loss ( L ) and LAE ( LE ) is $180.  There are no underwriting expenses or profit, so \nthe average total cost is $180, and rates are set accordingly.  \n\uf0b7 The insured population consists of 50,000 high-risk insureds (Level H) and 50,000 low-risk \ninsureds (Level L).  \n\uf0b7 The insurance market consists of two companies (Simple Company and Refined Company) that \neach currently insure 25,000 of each class of risk. \n\uf0b7 H risks have a cost of $230, and L risks have a cost of $130.  \n\uf0b7 Simple Company charges H and L risks the same rate, $180.  Refined Company implements a \nrating variable to vary the rates according to the cost and, therefore, charges H and L risks $230 \nand $130, respectively.   \n\uf0b7 1 out of every 10 insureds shops at renewal and bases the purchasing decision on price.", "type": "Document"}}
