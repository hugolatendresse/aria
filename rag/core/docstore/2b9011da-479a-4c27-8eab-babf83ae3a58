The \nprojected ultimate claims, developed in Exhibit I, Sheet 1, are summarized in Columns (4) and \n(5). Case outstanding, which are equal to the difference between reported claims and paid claims \nas of December 31, 2007, are presented in Column (6). Estimated IBNR is equal to projected \nultimate claims minus reported claims. In Columns (7) and (8), we calculate estimated IBNR \nbased on the reported and paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques, respectively. The total unpaid \nclaim estimate is equal to the sum of case outstanding and estimated IBNR. We present the \nestimate of total unpaid claims in Columns (9) and (10) based on the reported and paid \nBornhuetter-Ferguson techniques, respectively. \n \n \nWhen the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Technique Works and When it Does Not \n \nAn advantage of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique is that random fluctuations early in the life \nof an accident year (or other defined time interval) do not significantly distort the projections. For \nexample, if several large and unusual claims are reported for an accident year, then the reported \nclaim development technique may produce overly conservative ultimate claims estimates. This \nsituation does not, however, seriously distort the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. \n \nActuaries frequently use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method for long-tail lines of insurance, \nparticularly for the most immature years, due to the highly leveraged nature of claim development \nfactors for such lines. Actuaries may also use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique if the data is", "type": "Document"}}
