These \naverage claim costs, loaded for overhead and other costs that are not captured by the \ncomputerized tracking systems, can be applied within analytical frameworks as described by \nRahardjo and Mango-Allen (claim staffing technique).  \n \nA benefit of working with the underlying cost data that Spalla describes is that it allows for more \ndetailed analysis of the claim activity costs. Using the detailed information, the actuary can \ndetermine which types of claim transactions and which stages of the claim life cycle have \nrelatively similar (or different) costs. This insight can then assist the actuary in selecting different \ncosts for different transactions for the purpose of estimating unpaid ULAE. \n \nConger and Nolibos suggest \u201cthat the actuary using Spalla\u2019s method consider an equally \nimportant additional step as a \u2018reality check\u2019: if the selected costs per transaction were applied to \nthe numbers of transactions that were undertaken last year, would the result match that period\u2019s \nactual total ULAE expenditures?\u201d \n \nWhile Spalla describes determining the actual cost, the approach could also be used to quantify \nthe relative amount of cost per transaction as compared to the cost of other kinds of claim \n                                                 \n109 CAS Forum, Summer 1996. \n405", "type": "Document"}}
