We believe that the incorporation of closed claim counts into the selection of \nultimate claim counts may overstate the true value of projected ultimate claims. We observe that \nthis projection method results in significantly higher ultimate claims than all other methods \nsummarized in Exhibit I, Sheet 2. The estimate of total ultimate claims for all accident years \ncombined from frequency-severity approach method 1 is $551,155; the total ultimate claims for \nall other methods are less than $490,000. Thus, we exclude the frequency-severity method 1 from \nfurther consideration. \n \nFor the oldest seven years, 1998 through 2004, we observe fairly consistent results from the \nvarious projection methods. However, beginning in 2005, the differences become more \nsubstantial. A review of the estimated ultimate claim ratios and ultimate severities as well as the \nestimated IBNR can assist the actuary in the selection of ultimate claims. Another valuable \nstatistic is the estimated average case outstanding and unreported claim on open and IBNR \nclaims. \n \nThere are many acceptable ways to select ultimate claims in such an example. Some actuaries \nmay select one method and use it for all years. The Berquist-Sherman adjusted reported claim \n(both case and paid adjustments) method may be a reasonable selection for all years for XYZ \nInsurer. Alternatively, an actuary may select different methods for different accident years. For", "type": "Document"}}
