In the past, extension of exposures was practically \nimpossible due to the significant number of calculations required to rerate each policy.  Given the \ntremendous increase in computing power, the only remaining hurdle is associated with gathering the \nrequired data.  To adjust premium to the current rate level using the extension of exposures technique, the \npractitioner needs to know the applicable rating characteristics for every policy in the historical period.  \nOften companies do not have that information readily available.  \nReturning to the example, assume the actuary wishes to adjust the historical premium for Policy \nYear 2011 to the current rate level.  Assume one such policy was effective on March 1, 2011 and had 10 \nclass Y exposures.  The actual premium charged for the policy was based on the rates effective on \nJanuary 1, 2011, and was $7,370 (= 10 x $1,045 x 0.60 + $1,100).  To put the premium on-level, \nsubstitute the current base rate, class factor, and policy fee in the calculations; this results in an on-level \npremium of $8,405 (= 10 x $1,045 x 0.70 + $1,090).  This same calculation is performed for every policy \nwritten in 2011 and then aggregated across all policies.  \nIf a group of policies has the exact same rating characteristics, they can be grouped for the purposes of the \nextension of exposures technique.  This type of grouping is\u2014practically speaking\u2014only relevant in lines \nwith relatively simple rating algorithms and very few rating variables.      \nIn some commercial lines products, underwriters can apply subjective debits and credits to manual", "type": "Document"}}
