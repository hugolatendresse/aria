Deductibles are one of the most common types of insurer recoveries, and it is \nimportant for the actuary to understand how the insurer processes claims with respect to \ndeductibles. For some lines of insurance, such as automobile physical damage, claim payments to \ninsured policyholders are typically reduced due to the application of the deductible. Since this \nline of insurance is a first-party coverage, it is reasonable to apply the deductible before issuing \npayment to the insured. However, for general liability, insurers usually make claim payments \nbefore the application of the deductible. Since general liability is a third-party line of insurance, \nthe injured party is not the insured party. The insurer normally issues a payment to the injured \nparty and then, following the payment, seeks recovery of the deductible from the insured. Insurers \ndiffer in their practices with respect to case outstanding for deductibles.

When an insurer \npays an insured for a claim considered to be a total loss, the insurer acquires the rights to the \ndamaged property. Salvage represents any amount that the insurer is able to collect from the sale \nof such damaged property. Subrogation refers to an insurer\u2019s right to recover the amount of claim \npayment to a covered insured from a third-party responsible for the injury or damage.
