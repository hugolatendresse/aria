This is critical at all stages of the \nanalysis: \n \n\uf0be At the beginning of the analysis when the actuary is reviewing and reconciling the data \n \n\uf0be During the analysis especially when the actuary uses judgment in the process of developing \nan unpaid claim estimate \n \n\uf0be At the end of the analysis when the actuary evaluates the various projection methods and \nselects ultimate claims and unpaid claim estimates \n \nOne of the first checks that an actuary can conduct with the data provided for the analysis of \nunpaid claims is that net claim and net premium data are equal to or less than the gross data. \nReinsurance arrangements are typically categorized as quota share or excess of loss. If the \nreinsurance program consists of quota share arrangements, the actuary can create a development \ntriangle with the ratio of net-to-gross claims and thus test the quota share percentage(s) by year. \nThe actuary will want to confirm that the ratios in such a triangle are consistent with information \navailable for the insurer and consistent with relationships between net and gross premium. In \nExhibit II, Sheet 1, we present three triangles for an insurer who has maintained a quota share \nreinsurance program for the past four years. For 2005, the insurer had a 70% quota share \narrangement; the insurer increased the percentage to 85% in 2007 and to 90% in 2008. We \npresent the gross reported claims, the net reported claims, and the ratio of net to gross reported \nclaims. \n \nIf the reinsurance program consists of excess of loss arrangements, the actuary may want to \nexamine large claims to confirm that retentions and limits for ceded claims by year are consistent", "type": "Document"}}
