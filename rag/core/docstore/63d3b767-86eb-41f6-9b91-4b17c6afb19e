An example of internal data requirements is provided, as well as sources of \nexternal data. \nChapter 4 discusses insurance exposures, the basic unit that measures a policy\u2019s exposure to loss and \ntherefore serves as the basis for the calculation of premium.  The chapter outlines criteria for selecting \nexposure bases, methods and quantitative examples for defining and aggregating exposures, and \ncircumstances requiring a measurement of exposure trend. \nChapter 5 focuses on premium, the price the insured pays for the insurance product and one of the key \nelements of the fundamental insurance equation.  The chapter discusses different ways to define and \naggregate premium (including quantitative examples) and introduces standard techniques to adjust \nhistorical premium data to make it relevant for estimating future premium in the context of ratemaking.  \nThese adjustments include current rate level, premium development in consideration of premium audits, \nand premium trend.  These adjustments to premium are relevant in loss ratio analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
