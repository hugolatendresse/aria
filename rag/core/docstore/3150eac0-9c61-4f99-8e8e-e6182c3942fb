In \nChapter 6, we explain how actuaries use these types of triangles as diagnostic tools. \n \nFor some insurers, the actuary analyzes LAE data independently of claims only. In such \nsituations, the actuary may also create development triangles with the ratios of paid LAE-to-paid \nclaims only and the ratios of reported LAE-to-reported claims only. \n \nIn our discussion so far, we have not mentioned how many development periods the actuary \nneeds to evaluate. Is it necessary to analyze development through the 3rd maturity year, the 5th \nmaturity year, the 10th or the 20th maturity year? If possible, the actuary should analyze \ndevelopment out to the point at which the development ceases (i.e., until the selected \ndevelopment factors are equal to 1.000). The number of development periods required generally \nvaries by line, jurisdiction, and also by data type. For example, paid claims typically require a \ngreater number of development periods than reported claims, and reported claims often require a \ngreater number of development periods than reported claim counts. Also, automobile physical \ndamage claims settle much more quickly than general liability claims, and therefore an analysis \nof unpaid claims for automobile physical damage requires fewer development periods than a \nsimilar analysis for general liability.", "type": "Document"}}
