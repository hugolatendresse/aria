Most importantly, this \nassumption means that the general timing of ULAE expenditures (or of specified portions of \nULAE expenditures) follows the timing of the reporting or payment of claim dollars. In addition, \nthis assumption implies that a $1,000 claim requires ten times as much ULAE as a $100 claim.  \nIn the following sections, we describe four commonly used dollar-based techniques: \n \n\uf0b7 Classical (also known as traditional) \n\uf0b7 Kittel refinement  \n\uf0b7 Conger and Nolibos method \u2013 generalized Kittel approach \n\uf0b7 Mango-Allen refinement \n \n \nClassical (or Traditional) Technique \n \nIn the classical technique, the unpaid ULAE is estimated using a paid ULAE-to-paid claims ratio \ndetermined by comparing the calendar year paid ULAE to the calendar year paid claims.  \n \n \nKey Assumptions of Classical Technique \n \nKey assumptions of the classical technique include: \n \n\uf0b7 The insurer\u2019s ULAE-to-claim relationship has achieved a steady-state so that the ratio of paid \nULAE-to-paid claims provides a reasonable approximation of the relationship of ultimate \nULAE-to-ultimate claims. \n \n\uf0b7 The relative volume and cost of future claims management activity on not-yet-reported claims \nand reported-but-not-yet-closed claims will be proportional to the dollars of IBNR and case \noutstanding, respectively.  \n \nThe classical technique assumes that one-half of ULAE are sustained when opening a claim and \none-half is sustained when closing the claim. Thus, we apply 50% of the ULAE ratio to case \noutstanding, since, for known claims, one-half of the unallocated work was already completed at \nthe time of opening; and we apply 100% of the ULAE ratio to IBNR, since all unallocated work", "type": "Document"}}
