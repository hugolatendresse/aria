In order to \nsolve for one variable\u2019s unknowns, initial (seed) relativities for the other rating variable are chosen.  \nGenerally a sensible seed is the univariate pure premium relativities.  Hence, the urban relativity is the \ntotal urban loss costs divided by the total rural loss costs: \nt1 = 1.86 = ($497 / $267) \nt2 = 1.00. \nSubstituting these seed values into the first two equations above, we are able to solve for the first values \nof g1 and g2: \n170 x $650 + 90 x $300 = ($100 x 170 x g1 x 1.86) + ($100 x 90 x g1 x 1.00) \n$137,500 = ($31,620 x g1) + ($9,000 x g1) \n$137,500 = $40,620 x g1 \ng1 = 3.39. \n \n105 x $250 + 110 x $240 = ($100 x 105 x g2 x 1.86) + ($100 x 110 x g2 x 1.00) \n$52,650 = ($19,530 x g2) + ($11,000 x g2) \n$52,650 = $30,530 x g2 \ng2 = 1.72. \nWe can now use these seed values for gender, g1 and g2, and set up equations to solve for the new \nintermediate values of t1 and t2: \n170 x $650 + 105 x $250 = ($100 x 170 x 3.39 x t1) + ($100 x 105 x 1.72 x t1) \n$136,750 = ($57,630 x t1) + (18,060 x t1) \n$136,750 = $75,690 x t1 \nt1 = 1.81.", "type": "Document"}}
