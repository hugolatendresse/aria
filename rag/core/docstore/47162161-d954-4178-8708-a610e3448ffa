Thorne discussed the potential difficulty in selecting tail factors based on \nhistorical data in his review of the Berquist and Sherman paper \u201cLoss Reserve Adequacy Testing: \nA Comprehensive, Systematic Approach.\u201d Mr. Thorne noted: \n \nCare must be taken in projecting the tail from older accident years to recent \naccident years. For example, in Workers\u2019 Compensation the tail percentage may \nincrease due to trends in cumulative injury, shifts to unlimited medical benefits, \nand increases in the proportion of pension claims. On the other hand, the \npercentage may decrease due to trends in settlement practices for lump sum \nawards of for compromise and release of claims. The effects of certain factors \nmay be quantified by analysis of loss experience (such as claims by size or injury \ntype) or by specific sampling; other factors may require considerable judgment.42  \n \nThorne\u2019s comments are equally applicable today. The tail factor is crucial as it influences the \nunpaid claim estimate for all accident years (in the experience period) and can create a \ndisproportionate leverage on the total estimated unpaid claims. The tail factor, or a similar \nconcept, plays an important role not only in the development technique but in almost every \ntechnique discussed in Part 3 \u2013 Basic Techniques for Estimating Unpaid Claims.  \n \nActuaries use several approaches to evaluate the tail factor. One approach is to rely on industry \nbenchmark development factors. (See previous discussions regarding use of industry \nbenchmarks.) Another common approach is to fit a curve to the selected or observed development \nfactors to extrapolate the tail factors; exponential decay is a common assumption for such curve \nfitting. A third approach, used for paid development where the comparable reported development \nis already considered to be at ultimate, is to utilize reported-to-paid ratios at the latest observed", "type": "Document"}}
