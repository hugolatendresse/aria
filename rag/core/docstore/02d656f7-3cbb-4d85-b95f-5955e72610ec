This alternative is called claims-made coverage.  The major difference between claims-made \nand occurrence coverage is that the coverage trigger is the date the claim is reported rather than the date \nthe event occurs.  Consequently, the difference in pricing these products is not in the coverage provided, \nbut rather in the timing of the pricing decisions.  When pricing claims-made policies, the actuary only \nneeds to project claims reported during next year\u2019s policy period.  When pricing occurrence policies for \nprofessional liability and other long tail lines, the actuary must consider claims that will be reported many \nyears into the future. \nThis chapter covers: \n\uf0b7 Aggregation of losses by report year and report year lag \n\uf0b7 Coverage triggers for claims-made coverage \n\uf0b7 The five principles of claims-made policies \n\uf0b7 Issues related to coordinating coverage between claims-made and occurrence policies.", "type": "Document"}}
