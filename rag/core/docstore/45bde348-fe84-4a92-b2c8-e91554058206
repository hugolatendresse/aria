Because location tends to be heavily correlated with other factors and many locations \nhave very sparse data, special techniques are required to estimate the risk for each geographic unit.  Once \na geographic estimator is calculated for each unit, additional techniques are applied in order to combine \nthe units into territories.  Rate relativities for the territories can be derived using the methods described in \nthe previous rate classification chapters. \nIncreased limit factors are difficult to price as large losses tend to be rare.  Actuaries can price increased \nlimit factors for a given limit of insurance as the severity of losses at that limit divided by the severity of \nlosses at the basic limit.  Actuaries may use empirical data or fitted data for these calculations.  In some \ncases, actuaries may use multivariate analysis or other advanced techniques (e.g., ISO Mixed \nExponential).   \nPricing deductibles is similar to increased limits except that the loss is censored below the deductible \nrather than above the policy limit.  Actuaries generally calculate loss elimination ratios, which represent \nthe portion of the loss eliminated by the deductible.  This approach does not account for the varying \nbehavior of insureds that self-select different amounts of insurance; consequently, actuaries may \nsupplement their loss elimination ratio analysis with multivariate analysis that does capture behavioral \ndifferences.", "type": "Document"}}
