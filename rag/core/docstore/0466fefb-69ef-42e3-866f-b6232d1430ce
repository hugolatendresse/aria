For \ninsurance, the total profit is the sum of underwriting profit and investment income.   \nProfit.

This has also been called policyholder surplus although the funds may be from investors rather \nthan policyholders.  Companies invest these funds and earn investment income.  There is substantial \ndisagreement as to whether this source of income should be included in ratemaking or not. \nInsurers hold and invest money coming from two types of policyholder-supplied funds:  unearned \npremium reserves and loss reserves.  Insureds generally pay their premium at the onset of the policy \nalthough coverage is provided continuously throughout the entire policy.  The insurer holds and invests \nthat money (i.e., unearned premium) until such time it is earned.  The insurer also holds and invests funds \nto pay for claims that have occurred, but have not yet been settled (i.e., loss reserves).  The opportunity \nfor investment income from these funds varies significantly from line to line.  For lines of business where \nclaims are reported and settled quickly (i.e., short-tailed lines such as personal auto collision coverage or \nhomeowners insurance), there is only a short time between the payment of premium and the settling of \nclaims; consequently, the investment income will be relatively small.
