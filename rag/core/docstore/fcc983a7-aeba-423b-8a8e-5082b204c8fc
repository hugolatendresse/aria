The one-year subject experience comprises over one-third the exposures of the \nthree-year complement experience, thus it is most likely not independent.  Additionally, the large \ndifference between the one-year pure premium ($50) and the three-year pure premium ($64) \nsuggests the three-year data may be biased (i.e., changes in loss costs may have occurred that \nmakes the older data less relevant).  \n\uf0b7 Using the total of all experience combined ranks better with respect to independence as the latest \nyear of Rate Group A, Class 1 is only a small portion of the total experience (100 out of 4,000 \nexposures).  A comparison of the total one and three-year pure premiums suggests the total \nexperience has low process variance; however, the difference between the one-year Rate Group \nA, Class 1 pure premium ($50) and the one-year total pure premium ($74) implies a bias may be \npresent. \n\uf0b7 Using the one-year Rate Group A experience appears to be the best of the given options.  The \nRate Group A data should reflect risks that are more similar to Class 1.  Comparing the one-year \npure premium ($55) and three-year pure premium ($57) suggests it has a low process variance.  \nAlso, the one-year result is not significantly different than the one-year Rate Group A, Class 1 \nresult ($50), which suggests little bias.   \n\uf0b7 The data is not readily available to use the Class 1 data from all rate groups combined.  \nOtherwise, it is possible that would be a reasonable option.    \nEvaluation\t\nBecause the complement is based on a greater volume of data, it is likely to have a lower process variance \nthan the subject experience.
