Thus, the development method is appropriate for insurers in a \nrelatively stable environment. When there are no major organizational changes for the insurer and \nwhen there are no major external environmental changes, the development technique is an \nappropriate method to use in combination with other techniques for estimating unpaid claims.  \n \nHowever, if there are any changes to the insurer\u2019s operations (e.g., new claims processing \nsystems; revisions to tabular formulae for case outstanding; or changes in claims management \nphilosophy, policyholder deductibles, or the insurer\u2019s reinsurance limits), the assumption that the \npast will be predictive of the future may not hold true. Environmental changes can also invalidate \nthe primary assumption of the development technique. For example, when a major tort reform \noccurs (such as a cap on claim settlements or a restriction in the statute of limitations), actuaries \nmay no longer be able to assume that historical claim development experience will be predictive \nof future claims experience. In such situations, the actuary should consider alternative techniques \nfor estimating unpaid claims, or at the very least, adjust the selected claim development factors. \n \nThe development technique requires a large volume of historical claims experience. It works best \nwhen the presence or absence of large claims does not greatly distort the data. If the volume of \ndata is not sufficient, large claims could greatly distort the age-to-age factors, the projection of \nultimate claims, and finally the estimate of unpaid claims using a development method.
