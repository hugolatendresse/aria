In such a case, the company can adjust the base rate and the expense fee by the ratio of the \ntarget competitor\u2019s variable permissible loss ratio to the expected variable permissible loss ratio.  For \nexample, assume the company plans to use a commission percentage that is 5 percentage points higher \nthan the competitor\u2019s but all other variable expenses are expected to be the same.  Assuming that the \ncompetitor\u2019s variable expense ratio is 15% and the target profit percentage for both companies is 5%, then \nthe company should adjust the target competitor\u2019s base rate and expense fees by a factor of 1.067 \n[ = ( 1.0- 0.15 - 0.05 ) / (1.0 - 0.20 - 0.05 ) ].    \nThird, the company may believe its expected loss costs will be different than the target competitor\u2019s due \nto operational differences or a lack of experience with the product.  In such cases, the company should \njudgmentally change the base rate to account for the anticipated difference.  For example, the company \nmay feel its lack of experience in settling claims for the new product will result in expected costs that are \n5% to 10% higher than those of the target competitor\u2019s.  The company should increase the base rates by \n5% to 10% to account for this. \nFourth, the company may want to target a certain segment of the market that the competitor does not \nseem to be targeting.  In such a case, the company may adjust the rate differentials accordingly.  For \nexample, if the company aims to write a significant amount of new business in a certain territory, then it \nmay choose to reduce the rate differential in that territory.  If any adjustments are made, then the company \ncan adjust the base rate to offset the change in the average territorial differential. \nCOMMUNICATING\tAND\tMONITORING\t\nPrior to implementing a final set of rates, the ratemaking actuary typically communicates the expected", "type": "Document"}}
