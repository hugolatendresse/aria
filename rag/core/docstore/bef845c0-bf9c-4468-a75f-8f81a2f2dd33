Each of these sheets contains four parts that follow the first five steps of \nour description of the development method. Part 1 of each exhibit includes the data triangle. In \nour example, the data triangles contain reported and paid claim development experience for \naccident years 1998 through 2007. There are ten diagonals in each triangle with annual valuation \ndates of December 31, 1998 through December 31, 2007. The reported and paid claims data \ncontained in these exhibits are net of reinsurance and include the defense cost portion of claim \nadjustment expenses (labeled DCC for U.S. statutory accounting). \n \n \nStep 2 \u2013 Calculate Age-to-Age Factors \n \nThe next step is to calculate age-to-age factors. These factors are also known as report-to-report \nfactors or link ratios. They measure the change in recorded claims from one valuation date to the \nnext. In Part 2 of Exhibit I, Sheets 1 and 2, we present the age-to-age factors for U.S. Industry", "type": "Document"}}
