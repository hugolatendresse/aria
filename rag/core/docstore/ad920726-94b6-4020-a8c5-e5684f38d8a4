However, the total premium collected is adequate and the rates are equitable. \nCoinsurance\tClause\t\nCoinsurance implies that two or more parties are jointly participating in the insurance arrangement.  In \nproperty insurance, an insurer may implement a coinsurance clause in which the two parties are the \ninsurer and the insured.  Basically, the insurer may require a minimum insurance to value (e.g., 80% of \nfull value) or else payment on covered losses will be reduced proportionately by the amount of \nunderinsurance.42  The intent of the coinsurance requirement is to achieve greater equity among risks, \nthough more so through the payment of losses than the adequacy of rates. \nThe following notation is used in the coinsurance calculations:   \n\uf0b7 I =  i n d e m n i t y  r e c e i v e d  a f t e r  l o s s  \n\uf0b7 L =  a m o u n t  o f  l o s s  a f t e r  d e d u c t i b l e  \n\uf0b7 F =  f a c e  v a l u e  o f  p o l i c y  ( i . e . ,  a m o u n t  o f  i n s u r a n c e  s e l e c t e d )  \n\uf0b7 V = value of property \n\uf0b7 c =  r e q u i r e d  c o i n s u r a n c e  p e r c e n t a g e   \n\uf0b7 a =  a p p o r t i o n m e n t  r a t i o  \n\uf0b7 e =  c o i n s u r a n c e  p e n a l t y  \nUsing this notation, the coinsurance requirement (cV) is the amount of coverage required such that no \npenalty is applied.  The coinsurance apportionment ratio (a) is the relationship of the amount of insurance \nselected (F) to the coinsurance requirement (cV), and is the factor applied to the loss amount to calculate \nthe indemnity payment: \n.., cV\nFa \uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\uf03d 01min  \n                                                      \n42 In some countries (e.g., the U.K.), this is known as the Principle of Averages. \n11.15 Three Policies-Total Losses Only\n(1) (2) (3)\nFull Value of Item ($000s) 500 $              500 $              400 $", "type": "Document"}}
