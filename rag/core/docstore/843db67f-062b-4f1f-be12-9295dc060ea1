Note that the methods will be \ndiscussed in terms of annual accounting periods though other periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly) can be \nused, too.  Also, with the exception of calendar year aggregation, the annual period does not need to be a \ncalendar year (e.g., January 1 to December 31) but could be a fiscal year (e.g., July 1 to June 30) as well. \nCalendar year aggregation considers all premium and loss transactions that occur during the twelve-\nmonth calendar year without regard to the date of policy issuance, the accident date, or the report date of \nthe claim.  Calendar year earned premium and earned exposure implies all premium and exposures earned \nduring that twelve month period.  Hence, at the end of the calendar year, all premium and exposures are \nfixed.  Calendar year paid losses consider all loss paid during the calendar year regardless of occurrence", "type": "Document"}}
