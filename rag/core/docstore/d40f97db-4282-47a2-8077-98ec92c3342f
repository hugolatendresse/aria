Several of the methods can be \nused with loss ratio methods by replacing the exposure units with earned premium. \nLoss\tCosts\tof\ta\tLarger\tGroup\tthat\tInclude\tthe\tGroup\tbeing\tRated\t\nThis complement considers the experience of a larger group to which the subject experience belongs.  The \nfollowing are a few examples that may apply: \n\uf0b7 A multi-state insurer may use data from all states in the region to supplement the experience of \nthe state being reviewed. \n\uf0b7 A medical malpractice insurer may use the experience of all primary care physicians to \nsupplement the experience of primary care pediatricians.   \n\uf0b7 An auto insurer may use the data of all insureds ages 16-19 to supplement the experience of 16-\nyear-olds.  \n\uf0b7 An insurer may use data from a longer-term period to credibility-weight observed experience that \nis short-term. \nConsider the following data (adapted from Boor 2004, p 11) and the possibilities for a complement of \ncredibility to the observed experience, the latest year pure premium from Rate Group A, Class 1 ( = $50). \n \n \nSome of the obvious candidates for complement of credibility are the three-year pure premium for Rate \nGroup A, Class 1; the one- or three-year pure premium for Rate Group A; and the one- or three-year pure \npremium for the total of all experience.  While not shown, another option is the total of all Class 1 \nexperience across all rate groups.   \n  \n12.4 Data from a Larger Group\nRate \nGroup Clas s Expos ures\nPure \nPremium E xposures\nPure \nPremium\nA1 1 0 0 5 0 $            250 64 $", "type": "Document"}}
