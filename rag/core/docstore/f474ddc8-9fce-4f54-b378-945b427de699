This differs from the classical technique where paid ULAE is compared to actual \npaid claims.  \n \nThe second key assumption of the classical technique remains valid for the Mango-Allen \nrefinement. The relative volume and cost of future claims management activity on not-yet-\nreported claims and reported-but-not-yet-closed claims is expected to be proportional to the \ndollars of IBNR and case outstanding, respectively. Specifically, we assume that one-half of \nexpenses are sustained when opening a claim and one-half of expenses when closing a claim.  \n \n \nMechanics of Mango-Allen Refinement to the Classical Technique \n \nWe present the Mango-Allen refinement to the classical technique in Exhibit III for New Small \nInsurer, a new insurer specializing in lawyers\u2019 professional liability coverage. There are five steps \nin this technique: \n \n\uf0b7 Estimate calendar year expected paid claims \n \n\uf0b7 Develop ratio of historical calendar year paid ULAE-to-expected calendar year paid \nclaims  \n\uf0b7 Review historical ratios for trends or patterns \n \n\uf0b7 Select a ratio of ULAE-to-claims applicable to future claims payments \n \n\uf0b7 Apply 50% of the selected ULAE ratio to case outstanding and 100% of the selected \nULAE ratio to IBNR \n \nIn Exhibit III, Sheet 1, we begin the analysis by estimating expected paid claims for each of the \nfour calendar years in the experience period (i.e., 2005 through 2008). Expected calendar year \npayments are based on direct earned premium multiplied by an expected claims ratio and the \npercentage expected to be paid in each year.
