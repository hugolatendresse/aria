The \nrelative volume and cost of future claims management activity on not-yet-reported claims and \nreported-but-not-yet-closed claims is expected to be proportional to the dollars of IBNR and case \noutstanding, respectively. Specifically, we assume that one-half of expenses are sustained when \nopening a claim and one-half of expenses when closing a claim.  \n \n \nMechanics of the Kittel Refinement \n \nWe present the Kittel refinement to the classical technique in Exhibit II. There are four steps in \nthis technique: \n \n\uf0b7 Develop ratio of historical calendar year paid ULAE-to-average of calendar year paid and \ncalendar year incurred claims  \n \n\uf0b7 Review historical ratios for trends or patterns \n \n\uf0b7 Select a ratio of ULAE-to-claims applicable to future claims payments \n \n\uf0b7 Apply 50% of the selected ULAE ratio to case outstanding and 100% of the selected \nULAE ratio to IBNR \n \nUsing Kittel\u2019s refinement, we observe lower ULAE ratios than with the classical technique \n(traditional paid-to-paid approach). This is expected when incurred claims are greater than paid \nclaims on a calendar year basis. For both techniques, we note that the ULAE ratios are lower for \nthe two earliest years in the experience period (i.e., 2004 and 2005). Based on Kittel\u2019s refinement, \nwe select a ULAE ratio of 0.040. \n \nThe final step of Kittel\u2019s refined technique is identical to the classical technique. Assuming that \none-half of a claim\u2019s ULAE is sustained when the claim is reported and one-half when it is paid \n(i.e., closed), we estimate unpaid ULAE for XYZ Insurer to be $24.7 million using the formula \nwith total IBNR and $18.8 million using the formula with an adjustment to determine pure IBNR.", "type": "Document"}}
