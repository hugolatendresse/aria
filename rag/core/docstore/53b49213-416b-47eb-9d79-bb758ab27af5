In this text, the term rating variable refers to any \nvariable used to vary rates, even if it is based on a characteristic normally considered an underwriting \ncharacteristic.  The different values of the rating variable are referred to as levels.  In the example given, \nage of the home is the rating variable, and the different ages or age ranges are the levels.   \nOnce the insured population is subdivided into appropriate levels for each rating variable, the actuary \ncalculates the indicated rate differential relative to the base level for each level being priced.  If a rate \ndifferential is applied multiplicatively, it is often referred to as a rate relativity.  If the rate differential is \napplied additively, it is generally referred to as an additive.  Sometimes actuaries use the term class to \nrefer to a group of insureds that belong to the same level for each of several rating variables.  For \nexample, personal lines auto insurers frequently use the term class to refer to a group of insureds with the \nsame age, gender, and marital status.   \nThis chapter discusses: \n\uf0b7 The importance of charging equitable rates \n\uf0b7 Criteria for evaluating potential rating variables \n\uf0b7 Traditional univariate (one-way) techniques used to estimate the appropriate rate differentials for \nvarious levels of a given rating variable, including distortions introduced by each", "type": "Document"}}
