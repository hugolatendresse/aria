Insurance companies also derive profit from investment income, but a detailed discussion of \nthis topic is beyond the scope of this text. \nMaking those substitutions, the prior formula is transformed into the fundamental insurance equation: \n P r e m i u m =  L o s s e s  +  L A E  +  U W  E x p e n s e s  +  U W  P r o f i t .                                                  \nThe goal of ratemaking is to assure that the fundamental insurance equation is appropriately balanced.  In \nother words, the rates should be set so that the premium is expected to cover all costs and achieve the \ntarget underwriting profit.  This is covered in the second principle of the CAS \u201cStatement of Principles \nRegarding Property and Casualty Insurance Ratemaking\u201d (CAS Committee on Ratemaking Principles, \np. 6), which states \u201cA rate provides for all costs associated with the transfer of risk.\u201d  There are two key \npoints to consider in regards to achieving the appropriate balance in the fundamental equation: \n1. Ratemaking is prospective.   \n2. Balance should be attained at the aggregate and individual levels.", "type": "Document"}}
