The \ncomplete name for this U.S. coverage is workers compensation and employers liability \ninsurance. U.S. workers compensation also covers the cost to defend against, and possibly \npay, liability claims made against the employer (i.e., the insured) on account of bodily injury \nto an employee. \n \n \nKey Terminology \n \nWe generally use italics for the first reference and definition of a new term. Throughout this text, \nwe strive to use definitions contained within Standards of Practice and Statements of Principles of \nthe CAS and the Academy. We indicate where definitions of the CAS or Academy differ from the \nStandards of Practice of the CIA. We also strive to clearly identify wherever we deviate from \ndefinitions of the U.S. and Canadian professional actuarial organizations.  \n \nAt the end of each chapter, we present exhibits, some of which include multiple sheets, in Roman \nnumeric order. On all these exhibits, we include detailed footnotes supporting the calculations. \n \n \nInsurer \n \nThroughout this book, we use the term insurer to represent any risk bearer for P&C exposures, \nwhether an insurance company, self-insured entity, or other. There are certain situations where a \ndifferent approach or different factors within a technique may be more appropriate for insurance \ncompanies (including reinsurance companies) than self-insurers (including organizations with \nfunded self-insured programs, captive insurers, pooling associations, etc.). When this happens, we \nclearly identify the appropriate course of action for the specific type of risk bearer. \n \n \nReserves \n \nThe term reserves itself is tricky. The financial statements of insurers in the U.S. and Canada \ncontain many different types of reserves including: case reserves, loss reserves, bulk and IBNR", "type": "Document"}}
