For the first \nscenario, U.S. PP Auto Steady-State, all of the techniques produced an accurate estimate of \nunpaid claims. In this scenario, we assume that there are no changes in the underlying claim ratio \nor the strength of case outstanding. In the next three scenarios (U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim \nRatios, U.S. PP Auto Increasing Case Outstanding Strength, and U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim \nRatios and Case Outstanding Strength) the estimation techniques vary in their ability to \naccurately respond to the changing conditions.   \n \nWe also create an example based on a combined portfolio of private passenger and commercial \nautomobile insurance. Similar to the U.S. PP Auto Steady-State, all of the techniques used for the \nexample with a steady-state product mix (U.S. Auto Steady-State) produce the actual IBNR \nvalue. When the product mix changes, however, the methods respond differently to the changing \nconditions. \n \nThe following table summarizes the estimated IBNR for each of the projection techniques for all \nof the scenarios other than steady-state examples. The first line of the table shows the actual \nIBNR needed for each scenario.  \n \nEstimated IBNR ($000) \n \n \n \nEstimation Technique \n \nIncreasing \nClaim \nRatios \nIncreasing  \nCase \nOutstanding \nStrength \nIncreasing Claim  \nRatios and  \nCase Outstanding  \nStrength \n \nChanging \nProduct \nMix \nTrue IBNR 602 253 348 2,391 \nDevelopment \u2013 Reported 602 501 694 2,153 \nDevelopment \u2013 Paid 602 253 348 1,723 \nExpected Claims -843 253 -1,097 2,167 \nBornhuetter-Ferguson \u2013 Reported 439 458 460 2,168 \nBornhuetter-Ferguson \u2013 Paid 159 253 -96 1,991 \nBenktander \u2013 Reported 573 492 648 2,159", "type": "Document"}}
