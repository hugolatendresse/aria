As long as the distribution between the different \ncategories of business remains consistent (and there are no other operational or environmental \nchanges), the claim development method should produce an accurate estimate of unpaid claims. \nThe top section of Exhibit IV, Sheet 6 contains detailed calculations, similar to those presented \nearlier in this chapter. \n \n \nU.S. Auto Changing Product Mix \n \nWe present the calculations for the scenario with a change in product mix in the bottom section of", "type": "Document"}}
