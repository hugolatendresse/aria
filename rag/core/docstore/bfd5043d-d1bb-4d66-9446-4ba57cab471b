Second, the actuary must select an annual \nseverity trend to adjust the average case outstanding values from the selected diagonal to all other \naccident year-maturity age cells in the triangle. \n \nIn the medical malpractice example, Berquist and Sherman selected the latest diagonal as the \nstarting point and a 15% annual severity trend. (The annual trend rate was based on a review of \nthe historical experience for the specific insurer as well as overall insurance industry experience \nat the time.) In Exhibit I, Sheet 6, we present the adjusted average case outstanding triangle. The \nlast diagonal does not change from the unadjusted average case outstanding triangle which we \npresent in Exhibit I, Sheet 4. However, we now derive all other values by formula; these shaded \nvalues differ from the original triangle. The calculations proceed within each column starting with \nthe latest point and the selected severity trend rate. For example, the 1975 adjusted average case \noutstanding at 12 months of $11,329 is equal to the 1976 average case outstanding at 12 months \nof $13,028 divided by 1.151, which represents one year of trend. Similarly, we calculate the 1970 \nadjusted average case outstanding at 48 months of $21,873 based on the 1973 average case \noutstanding of $33,266 divided by 1.153, which represents three years of trend. \n \nThe intent of these calculations is to restate the average case outstanding triangle so that each \ndiagonal in the triangle is at the same case outstanding adequacy level as the latest diagonal (i.e., \nlatest valuation). To determine the adjusted reported claims, we multiply the adjusted average \ncase outstanding by the number of open claims and then add the unadjusted paid claims. In \nExhibit I, Sheet 7, we analyze the adjusted reported claim triangle and select development factors \nfor each age-to-age maturity. At the bottom of this exhibit, we compare the selected development", "type": "Document"}}
