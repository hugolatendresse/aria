For example, if the cumulative development \nfactor is 0.93, then the credibility assigned to the development method is equal to 1.075 (1.00 / \n0.93). However, as defined above, credibility must be a value between 0 and 1. Thus, a credibility \nvalue of 1.075 is outside of the acceptable range.  \n \nWhile cumulative development factors that are less than 1.00 present a theoretical issue for the \nuse of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, in practice, many actuaries continue to use this method \nwith such factors. One solution to address this theoretical challenge is to limit the cumulative \ndevelopment factors to a minimum value of 1.00 when applying the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \ntechnique. (We follow this approach for the examples in this text.) Alternatively, and what \nhappens quite frequently in practice, is that the actuary will still calculate the reported \nBornhuetter-Ferguson projected ultimate claims using cumulative development factors that are \nless than 1.00 but will rely on another technique to select ultimate claims for the year(s) in \nquestion (i.e., years with cumulative development factors less than 1.00). As noted previously in \nthis chapter, actuaries frequently use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method for long-tail lines of \ninsurance, particularly for the most immature years. Cumulative development factors for these \nlines and years are typically much greater than 1.00. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that \nsome actuaries continue to include the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method as part of their analyses \neven in the presence of cumulative development factors that are less than 1.00. \n156", "type": "Document"}}
