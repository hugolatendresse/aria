For example, at 24 months, the average case outstanding values for the last two \naccident years are $22,477 and $32,160 compared to $13,785 and $11,433 for the preceding two \naccident years. \n \nWe use an exponential regression analysis to determine the annual trend rate in the average case \noutstanding at each maturity age. We fit the average case outstanding at each maturity age with \nthe accident year. At the bottom of Exhibit I, Sheet 4, we present the fitted trend rate and the R-\nsquared test for each maturity age. The R-squared test provides an indication of the goodness of \nthe exponential fit for each maturity age. We observe annual trend rates of roughly 30% for \nmaturity ages 24 months through 72 months with R-squared values of 85% or greater for all of \nthese ages.73 \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheet 5, we continue our testing by calculating the ratios of paid-to-reported claims \nand reviewing the trend rates inherent in the average paid claim triangle. If there had been an \nincrease in the case outstanding adequacy level, which seems apparent based on a review of the \naverage case outstanding triangle, we would expect the ratios of paid-to-reported claims to be \ndecreasing along the latest two diagonals of the triangle. While we see some decreases in this \nratio triangle, there is substantial variability and it is hard to draw definitive conclusions based on \nthis diagnostic alone. \n \n                                                 \n73 We again remind the reader that the results of regression analyses with limited data points must be used \nwith caution. \n285", "type": "Document"}}
