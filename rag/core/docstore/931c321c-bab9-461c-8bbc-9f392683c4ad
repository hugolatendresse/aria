Examples of each are provided.   \nStandard\tCalculations\t\nThe objective of the parallelogram method is to replace the average rate level for a given historical year \nwith the current rate level.  The major steps for the parallelogram method are as follows: \n1. Determine the timing and amount of the rate changes during and after the experience period and \ngroup the policies into rate level groups according to the timing of each rate change. \n2. Calculate the portion of the year\u2019s earned premium corresponding to each rate level group. \n3. Calculate the cumulative rate level index for each rate level group. \n4. Calculate the weighted average cumulative rate level index for each year.  \n5. Calculate the on-level factor as the ratio of the current cumulative rate level index and the average \ncumulative rate level index for the appropriate year. \n6. Apply the on-level factor to the earned premium for the appropriate year. \n \nFor the parallelogram method, the exact rates are not required as the calculations only use the overall \naverage percent rate changes.  Returning to our example, Table 5.16 contains the relevant information for \nStep 1:  the effective date and overall rate change amount for four different rate level groups.  In this \nexample, the policies are annual and the rate changes apply to policies effective on or after the date (i.e., \ndo not apply to policies in mid-term). \n \nFor Step 2, it is helpful to view these rate changes in graphical format.  Assume the actuary is trying to \nadjust each calendar year\u2019s earned premium to current rate level.  As noted earlier in the chapter, calendar \nyears are represented by squares.  The rate changes in this example only impact policies written on or \nafter the effective date; therefore, each rate change is represented by a diagonal line.  The slope of the", "type": "Document"}}
