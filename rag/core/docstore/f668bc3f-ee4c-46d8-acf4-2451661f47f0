We use the benchmark reported and paid claim development factors to ultimate to \nderive the development factor for case outstanding. The following presents the formula for the \ncase outstanding development factor: \n \n  (Reported CDF to Ultimate \u2013 1.00) x (Paid CDF to Ultimate)  + 1.00 \n                      (Paid CDF to Ultimate \u2013 Reported CDF to Ultimate) \n \nThe resulting case development factor includes provisions for case outstanding and IBNR (the \nbroad definition of IBNR, which includes development on known claims). The estimated unpaid \nclaims for GL self-insurer are shown in Column (6) of Exhibit III and are equal to the current \nestimate of case outstanding multiplied by the derived case outstanding CDF to ultimate. \n \n \nPotential Limitations \n \nThere are a few potential drawbacks of this case outstanding development approach. First, by its \nnature, this technique is used when historical claims experience specific to the insurer (or self-\ninsurer) is not available, and thus industry benchmarks development patterns are required. Such \nbenchmarks may prove to be inaccurate in projecting future claims experience for the particular \ninsurer. Furthermore, this technique is generally inappropriate for the more recent, less mature \nyears due to the increased variability of results related to the highly leveraged nature of the \nderived development factors. Finally, individual large claims present in the case outstanding data \ncan distort the results of projections based on this approach.\n269", "type": "Document"}}
