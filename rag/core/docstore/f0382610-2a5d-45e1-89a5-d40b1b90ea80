CART can also help detect interactions between variables. \nMARS\t\nThe Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) algorithm operates as a multiple piecewise linear \nregression where each breakpoint defines a region for a particular linear regression equation.  This \ntechnique is generally used to select breakpoints for categorizing continuous variables.  For example, in \nhomeowners insurance, amount of insurance may be treated as a categorical factor despite being \ncontinuous in nature.
