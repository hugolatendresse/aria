More specifically, \npolicy growth rate is defined as: \n1.0,Period ofOnset at Policies\nPeriod of Endat   Policies\nPeriodofOnset at  Policies\nPolicies)Lost   - Written  Policies (New Growth Policy   % \uf02d\uf03d\uf03d      \nwhere a \u201clost policy\u201d can either be a cancelled or non-renewed policy.  Assume there were 360,000 \npolicies at the beginning of the month.  If 9,600 new policies were added and 6,000 policies were lost \nduring the month, then the monthly policy growth is 1.0% ( = [ 9,600 - 6,000 ] / 360,000 ).  As with \nretention and close \nratios, growth \npercentages are \ntracked over time.  \nLow or negative \ngrowth can \nindicate \nuncompetitive \nrates and vice \nversa.  Of course, \nchanges in growth \ncan also be \nsignificantly \nimpacted by items \nother than price.  \nFor example, if a \ncompany tightens \nor loosens the underwriting standards, growth can be affected.  In general, companies want to be aware of \nrapid changes in the volume of insureds and monitor the effect on profitability.  Chart 13.12 shows \nmonthly policy growth. \nThe close, retention, and growth ratios described above were calculated at the aggregate level.  \nCompanies may also track these for specific groups of insureds.  If any of the ratios look significantly \nworse for a particular segment despite having similar competitiveness as other segments, then it may be \nan indication that the particular segment is more price sensitive, that the competitive rate comparisons are \nnot valid, or that something other than price is driving the purchasing decision.  Chart 13.13 shows an \nexample of close ratios by age of named insured.  The bars represent the number of applicants (right y-\naxis) and the line represents the close ratio (left y-axis) by age of applicant (x-axis). \n350,000 \n352,000 \n354,000 \n356,000 \n358,000 \n360,000 \n362,000 \n364,000 \n366,000 \n368,000 \n370,000 \n0.0%\n0.1%\n0.2%\n0.3%\n0.4%\n0.5%", "type": "Document"}}
