The following formula defines calendar year earned premium: \n \nWritten Premium + Beginning Unearned Premium Reserve \u2013 Ending Unearned Premium Reserve \n \n \nAdvantages of Calendar Year Data \n \nA major advantage of calendar year data is that there is no future development. The value remains \nfixed and does not change as time goes by as do claims and exposures aggregated based on \naccident year, policy year, and even report year bases. Another advantage of calendar year data is \nthat it is readily available. Most insurers conduct financial reporting on a calendar year basis, thus \ndata by calendar year is typically easily accessible to the actuary.  \n \n \nDisadvantages of Calendar Year Data \n \nThe fixed nature of calendar year data also presents a disadvantage. The inability to address the \ncritical issue of development is a disadvantage of calendar year statistics. Very few techniques for \nestimating unpaid claims are based on calendar year claims. Calendar year exposures, on the \nother hand, are frequently used in estimation techniques along with accident year claims. \n \n \nAggregation by Accident Year \n \nAggregation by accident year is, by far, the most common grouping of claims data for the \nactuarial analysis of unpaid claims. Accident year data refers to claims grouped according to the \ndate of occurrence (i.e., the accident date or the coverage triggering event). For example, accident \nyear 2008 consists of all claims with an occurrence date in 2008.  \n \nCaution must be exercised when working with self-insurers\u2019 accident year data as their fiscal year \nends may not coincide with the calendar year-end. For example, accident year 2008 may be \ndefined to coincide with a self-insurer\u2019s August 1, 2007 to July 31, 2008 fiscal year or may \ninclude claims occurring during the January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 calendar year period.", "type": "Document"}}
