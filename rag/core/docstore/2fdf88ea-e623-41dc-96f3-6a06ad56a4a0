The first two \napproaches have historical precedence.  The latter approach addresses some distortions that can result \nfrom the other methods if fixed expenses are a significant portion of total expenses. \nIn addition to underwriting expenses (and the loss adjustment expenses covered in Chapter 6), companies \nmay also explicitly consider the cost of reinsurance as an expense in a ratemaking analysis.   \nCompanies are entitled to a reasonable expected profit.  The two main sources of profit for insurance \ncompanies are investment income and underwriting profit.  Traditionally, an underwriting profit provision \nis selected such that there is a reasonable expectation that the underwriting profit and investment income \nwill generate total profit to appropriately compensate the insurer for the risk assumed.", "type": "Document"}}
