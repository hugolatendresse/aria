The bars represent the percentage of policies \n(right y-axis) getting different percentage change in premium (x-axis).  The lines illustrate the insured\u2019s \npropensity to renew (left y-axis) depending on whether it is the first or subsequent renewal for the \ninsured.  As the premium changes increase, the blue line drops more steeply than the red line, highlighting \nthat the longer the insured is with the carrier, the less sensitive he or she is to premium increases. \nA loss cost model and a customer demand model can be used together to estimate expected premium \nvolume, losses, and total profits for a given rate proposal.  For renewal business, the loss cost and \nretention models project the expected profitability and probability of renewal for each existing risk at a \ngiven price.  Given these models, a company can test several rate change scenarios on the in-force \ndistribution to determine the expected volume, premium, losses, and profit of each scenario.  The \nobjective is to identify the rate change that best achieves the company\u2019s profitability and volume goals on \nthe renewal portfolio.  This same process can also test multiple rate scenarios on new business by \napplying the results of loss cost models and conversion models on a portfolio of quotes.   \nScenario testing rate changes is a precursor to full price optimization.  Optimization algorithms \nincorporate loss cost models, demand models, and other assumptions as inputs, and generate hundreds of \nthousands of scenarios to determine the premium for each individual risk that optimizes overall profit \nwhile achieving a company\u2019s overall volume goals (or optimize volume while achieving a company\u2019s \noverall profitability goals).  The algorithms can be as simple or complex as desired.  Complex algorithms \nmay take into account several per policy constraints (e.g., minimum premium or profit per policy),", "type": "Document"}}
