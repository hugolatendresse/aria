Is the change in case outstanding adequacy masking the changes \nin the settlement process? We also ask if the type of claims reported is changing. Different types \nof claims have different settlement and reporting characteristics. This could have an effect on \nboth paid and reported claims. \n \n \nThe Ratio of Paid Claims to On-Level Earned Premium \n \nNext, we decide to review the ratio of cumulative paid claims to on-level earned premium. We \nhope that a review of this diagnostic triangle will provide insight as to whether there was a speed-\nup in claims payment or possibly deterioration in underwriting results. \n \nTable 7 \u2013 Ratio of Cumulative Paid Claims to On-Level Earned Premium \nAccident Ratio of Cumulative Paid Claims to On-Level Earned Premium as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 \n2002  0.041   0.142   0.247   0.395   0.571   0.727   0.795  \n2003  0.029   0.104   0.211   0.380   0.573   0.653   \n2004  0.028   0.123   0.323   0.540   0.657    \n2005  0.031   0.126   0.278   0.412     \n2006  0.051   0.171   0.331      \n2007  0.071   0.238       \n2008  0.071        \n \nThere does appear to be evidence of a possible speed-up in payments, particularly at 12 and 24 \nmonths. The question still remains as to whether or not there has been a shift in the type of claim \nsettled at each age. At this point, we request additional data (reported and closed claim counts) \nand create new development diagnostic triangles for further review. \n \n \nClaim Count Triangles \n \nJust as we review the reported and paid claim triangles above, we also review the triangles of \nreported and closed claim counts. \n \nTable 8 \u2013 Reported Claim Count Development Triangle \nAccident Reported Claim Counts as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 \n2002 1,342 1,514 1,548 1,557 1,549 1,552 1,554 \n2003 1,373 1,616 1,630 1,626 1,629 1,629  \n2004 1,932 2,168 2,234 2,249 2,258", "type": "Document"}}
