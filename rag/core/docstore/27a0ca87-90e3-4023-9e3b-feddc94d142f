For \nexample, a -1% selected annual frequency trend and a +2% selected annual severity trend combine to \nproduce a +1% (= ( 1.0 - 1% ) x ( 1.0 + 2%) - 1.0 ) selected annual pure premium trend.  \nTable 6.14 is an example of using an exponential fit.  When using a linear trend approach, the actuary \ncalculates the difference in the frequency, severity, and pure premium rather than the percentage \ndifference.  The linear fit produces a constant amount of change (rather than a percentage change).  For \nexample, the dollar change based on the 20-point linear fit on the pure premium data is -$0.75. \nCatastrophe losses are normally excluded from the loss trend analysis data.  If unusually large individual \nlosses are present, the actuary may choose to remove or adjust the extraordinary losses or select loss \nseverity trends based on basic limits loss data.  If catastrophe or large losses cannot be identified, the use \nof 12-month rolling averages is disadvantageous since one event will transfer to multiple data points.22  In \nthe case of a catastrophe, the frequency and severity will each likely increase significantly when the \ncatastrophe claims enter the trend data and decrease significantly when the catastrophe claims no longer \nexist in the data.  Extraordinary losses tend to be singular claims, so they generally only impact severity.   \nIf the data cannot be directly adjusted, the actuary can judgmentally account for the catastrophes or \nextraordinary losses when making the loss trend selections.   \nChanges in benefit levels can also affect trend analyses.  For example, if a law change increases the \nexpected payments by 10% for all claims occurring after a certain date, it will appear as a positive \nseverity trend until all claims are being settled under the new law.
