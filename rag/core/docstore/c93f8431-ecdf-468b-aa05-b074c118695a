In \nExhibit I, Sheet 5, we summarize the triangles of reported claims (in thousands of dollars) and \nreported severities (i.e., average reported claim). We analyze the reported severity triangle and \nselect development factors in Exhibit I, Sheet 6. Since we note some seasonality in the claim \ncount triangle, we also check for seasonality differences between the half-years in the triangle of \nreported severities. There does appear to be greater development for accident half-years ending \nDecember rather than June, particularly for the older periods in the triangle. In such a situation, \nthe actuary should seek further explanation from claims management professionals to fully \nunderstand the factors influencing the claim development patterns. In our example, we select a 6-\nto-12 month factor of 1.039 based on the medial average (i.e., average excluding high and low \nvalues) and the assumption that the experience of the most recent few years is more \nrepresentative of future experience than the earliest periods in the triangle. We also use the medial \naverage to select the age-to-age factors for the remaining maturities. \n \n \nProject Ultimate Claims \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheet 7, we multiply the projected ultimate severities by the projected ultimate claim \ncounts to determine the projected ultimate claims by accident half-year period.", "type": "Document"}}
