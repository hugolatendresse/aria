For Auto BI Insurer, we \nhave nine years (2000 through 2008) of historical accident year claims and premium data. We \nsummarize the reported and paid claim development projections in Columns (2) through (7). We \nfirst present the latest diagonals of the reported and paid claim triangles, claims as of the \nDecember 31, 2008 valuation date (Columns (2) and (3)). Cumulative claim development factors, \nselected based on Auto BI Insurer\u2019s historical experience, are summarized in Columns (4) and \n(5). We then calculate projected ultimate claims in Columns (6) and (7) using the development \ntechnique applied to reported and paid claims, respectively. In this example, we develop an initial \n(a priori) estimate of ultimate claims in Column (8) based on the average of the reported and paid \nclaim development projections. \n \nUp to this point, the analysis is the same as that described in the previous chapter on the \ndevelopment technique. Now, however, we move into new territory. Our goal is to develop an \nexpected claim ratio for accident year 2008. The claim ratio will be based on historical claims and \npremiums of Auto BI Insurer. In our calculations, we need both the premiums and claims to be at \nthe cost levels expected in 2008. Our first adjustment is to the premiums. We develop on-level \npremiums to account for rate changes implemented during the nine-year experience period. We \nrequire all premiums for each calendar year 2000 to 2007 to be restated as if 2008 rates were \neffective in each respective year. Such restated premiums are also known as on-level premiums. \nColumn (9) contains the on-level earned premium for Auto BI Insurer.", "type": "Document"}}
