Balancing data \nto other verified sources should be undertaken at this point. \n \n\uf0be Applying appropriate techniques for estimating unpaid claims. \n \n\uf0be Evaluating the conflicting results of the various methods used, with an attempt to reconcile or \nexplain the different outcomes. At this point, the projected ultimate amounts are evaluated in \ncontexts outside their original frame of analysis. \n \n\uf0be Monitoring projections of claim development over subsequent calendar periods. Deviations \nof actual development from projected development of counts or amounts are one of the most \nuseful diagnostic tools in evaluating the accuracy of unpaid claim estimates. \n \nIn Chapters 3 through 6 of this book, we focus on Mr. Wiser\u2019s first phase, the exploratory \nanalysis of the data. The process for collecting and understanding the data and other relevant \ninformation is so critical that we devote four chapters to the topic. We begin Chapter 3 with a \ndescription of the types of data that actuaries use for estimating unpaid claims and present various \noptions for organizing the data. \n  \nEqually important to collecting quantitative data is developing an understanding of the \nenvironment in which the insurer operates. In Chapter 4, we discuss the importance of meeting \nwith the management of both the claims and underwriting departments to gain a more complete \nunderstanding of the environment in which the insurer operates. We provide a list of possible \nquestions for actuaries to use in their meetings with management. Changes in the insurer\u2019s \ninternal operations as well as changes in the external setting can affect the results of the various", "type": "Document"}}
