One way to do this is to \nchange the make-up of the portfolio of insureds.  For example, a company may tighten the underwriting \ncriteria or non-renew policies that have grossly inadequate premium relative to expected costs.  It is \nimportant to note that when the portfolio changes, both the expected losses and expected premium may \nchange; however, if the loss reduction is greater than the premium reduction, the underwriting action \ncould move the fundamental equation to the balanced position.  If a company does this, then the actuary \nshould adjust the premium and loss projections and recalculate the overall rate level indication.   \nAnother way to reduce average expected loss is to reduce the coverage provided by the policy.  A \nreduction or expansion of coverage is referred to as a coverage level change.  For example, a homeowners \ninsurer may adjust the policy to exclude coverage for mold losses.  If this action eliminates previously \ncovered losses and rates are not decreased accordingly, then this coverage level change is equivalent to a \nrate level increase.  In the simple example, the company needs to reduce the average expected loss and \nLAE from $180 to $168 to bring the fundamental insurance equation into equilibrium.  If a company \naccomplishes such a change, then the actuary should adjust the projected losses and LAE and recalculate \nthe overall rate level indication. \nThese two methods above are not the only approaches to reduce average expected loss.  Companies may \nalso institute better loss control procedures.  For example, a workers compensation carrier may be able to \nreduce average severity by applying proactive medical management procedures and return-to-work \nprograms for disability claims that are likely to escalate.   \nPRICING\tSOLUTIONS\t\nThe typical company response to an unbalanced fundamental equation is to adjust the rates or expect an", "type": "Document"}}
