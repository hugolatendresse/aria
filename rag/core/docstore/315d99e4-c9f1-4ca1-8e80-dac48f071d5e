The ultimate claims estimate does not change unless \nthe exposures or claim ratio (or pure premium) assumptions change. While there is a potential \nadvantage in the stability of the projections, there is a potential disadvantage in a lack of \nresponsiveness to recent experience. Because, the technique ignores actual claims experience as \nreported, the method is not responsive when the actual claims experience differs from the initial \nexpectations. This is evident in the U.S. Industry Auto example presented earlier in this chapter. \n \nThere are times, however, when the actuary will judgmentally adjust the claim ratios based on \nhistorical experience due to a belief that either the pricing or underwriting or both are changing. \nIn such a situation, the actuary may be able to adjust the a priori expectation in advance of \nchanges being fully manifest in the data. In this circumstance, the expected claims method could \nprove to be more responsive than data-dependent methods. \n \n \nInfluence of a Changing Environment on the Expected Claims Technique \n \nIn the prior chapter on the development technique, we discuss the performance of the \ndevelopment method during times of change. In this section, we continue with these examples \nusing the expected claims technique.  \n \n \n137", "type": "Document"}}
