The actuary must understand \nwhether the paid claims are cumulative or incremental, whether they include or exclude claim-\nrelated expenses (and what kind of claims expenses), and whether they are net or gross of \nrecoveries.  \n \nThe actuary must also understand how the insurer\u2019s system tracks claim counts. The number of \nclaims is an important type of data for several techniques used to estimate unpaid claims. Claim \ncounts are also critical to several diagnostic analyses that may be appropriate to undertake upon \ncommencing an analysis of unpaid claims. Claim counts may also be important at the conclusion \nof the estimation process when the actuary evaluates and selects a final value for the unpaid claim \nestimate. The actuary needs to understand whether the insurer counts an automobile accident with \npayments for multiple coverages (e.g., bodily injury liability and physical damage) or to multiple \nparties (i.e., claimants) as one claim or multiple claims. Another important consideration for the \nactuary is how reopened claims are treated and whether they are considered a new claim. \nReopened claims can be particularly important for some lines of business, such as U.S. workers \ncompensation and accident benefits coverages. \n \nIt is absolutely essential to the development of appropriate estimates of unpaid claims that \nactuaries clearly identify the specific data that exists and that they are requesting from the insurer, \nand that they fully understand the data that they receive. \n \n \nVerification of the Data \n \nAn analysis based on incorrect or incomplete data can produce erroneous results. Therefore, \nwhile not requiring a formal audit of the data, actuarial standards of practice generally do require \nthat actuaries establish suitable procedures to verify that the data utilized is reliable and sufficient", "type": "Document"}}
