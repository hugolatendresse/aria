For \nmany commercial insurance products, the creation of homogenous groups for ratemaking purposes is not \nfeasible, and without adjustment, individual risk experience can be expected to vary widely around the \naverage group rate.  In addition, some commercial risks are sufficiently large that their historical \nexperience can be used in whole or in part to derive an individual rate.  Consequently, commercial lines \nratemaking employs special techniques that address the heterogeneity and credibility of commercial risks.   \nThis chapter covers the following topics:  \n\uf0b7 Manual rate modification mechanisms:  experience rating and schedule rating  \n\uf0b7 Rating techniques for large commercial risks:  large deductible plans, loss-rated composite rating, \nand retrospective rating plans \nCommercial risks may be subject to one or many of these rating mechanisms. \nExamples of each type of rating mechanism are provided.  \nMANUAL\tRATE\tMODIFICATION\tTECHNIQUES\t\nManual rate modification techniques rely on past experience and/or risk characteristics not adequately \nreflected in the manual rate or the past experience.  There are two basic types of manual rate modification \ntechniques:  experience rating and schedule rating. \nExperience\tRating\t\nExperience rating is used when an individual insured\u2019s past experience, with appropriate adjustments, is \ndetermined to be predictive of the future experience.  This determination is reflected in eligibility criteria, \ntypically based on size of manual premium.  The experience rating adjustment for the future policy period \nmanual premium is equal to a credibility weighting of the adjusted past experience (often referred to as", "type": "Document"}}
