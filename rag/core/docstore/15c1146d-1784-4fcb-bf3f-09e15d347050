As the number of observations gets larger, the B\u00fchlmann credibility estimate is closest to the \nclassical credibility estimate when K equals 1,500 (i.e., the dotted line).  Many practitioners using \nclassical credibility make simplifying assumptions\u2014for example, they ignore the variation in the size of \nlosses and assume that the risks in the subject experience are homogeneous.  If these same assumptions \nare made with least squares credibility, then VHM = 0 (this is because all of the exposures have exactly \nthe same claim distribution).  When VHM = 0, then Z = 0 and no credibility is assigned to the observed \nexperience.  \nThe B\u00fchlmann credibility formula has a number of assumptions, summarized as follows: \n\uf0b7 (1.0-Z) is applied to the prior mean. \n\uf0b7 The risk parameters and risk process do not shift over time. \n\uf0b7 The expected value of the process variance (EVPV) of the sum of N observations increases with \nN. \n\uf0b7 The variance of the hypothetical means (VHM) of the sum of N observations increases with N. \nSimple\tExample\t\nCalculate the B\u00fchlmann credibility-weighted estimate assuming the following: \n\uf0b7 The observed pure premium is $200 based on 21 observations. \n\uf0b7 The expected value of the process variance (EVPV) is 2.00. \n\uf0b7 The variance of the hypothetical means (VHM) is 0.50.  \n\uf0b7 The prior mean is $225. \nGiven that information, \n,00.450.0\n00.2\nVHM\nEVPV  \uf03d\uf03d\uf03dK  \nand \n;84.000.421\n21 \uf03d\uf02b\uf03dZ  \nconsequently, \n  Credibility-weighted Pure Premium $204.  $225 x 0.84)-(1  $200 x 0.84  \uf03d\uf02b\uf03d  \nComments\ton\tApproach\t\nWhile not as common as classical credibility, least squares credibility is used within the insurance \nindustry and is generally accepted.
