One major difference is the underlying loss \nmeasure used.  The loss ratio indication formula relies on the loss ratio (i.e., projected ultimate losses and \nLAE divided by projected premium at current rate level), and the pure premium indication formula relies \non the pure premium statistic (i.e., projected ultimate losses and LAE divided by projected exposures).  \nThe significance of this difference is that the loss ratio indication formula requires premium at current rate \nlevel and the pure premium indication formula does not.  Similarly, the pure premium indication formula \nrequires clearly defined exposures whereas the loss ratio indication formula does not.   \nDue to this difference, the pure premium approach is preferable if premium is not available or if it is very \ndifficult to accurately calculate premium at current rate level.  For example, the rating algorithm for some \ninsurance products (e.g., personal automobile insurance) may include a large number of rating variables.  \nIf there were a significant number of changes made to those variables during the historical period, it may \nbe difficult to calculate the premium at current rate level.  In contrast, the loss ratio method is preferable if \nexposure data is not available or if the product being priced does not have clearly defined exposures.  For \nexample, commercial general liability (CGL) policies have multiple sub-lines intended to protect \npolicyholders against a broad range of risks; as such, CGL policies can have different exposure bases for \nthe various sub-lines included.  Consequently, when pricing CGL, it may be easier to obtain and use \npremium at current rate level rather than trying to define a consistent exposure. \nThe other major difference is that the output of the two formulae is different.
