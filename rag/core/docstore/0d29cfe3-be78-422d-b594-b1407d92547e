They may also group claims by policy limits to achieve \nsimilar claims attributes within a block of business. \n \nThe goal for the actuary is to divide the data into sufficiently homogeneous groupings without \ncompromising the credibility of the data. Credibility refers to the predictive value given to a \ngroup of data. Increasing the homogeneity of the group of data or increasing the volume of data in \nthe group tends to increase credibility. If the actuary divides the data into too many homogeneous \ngroupings, however, there is a risk that the volume of data in the individual groups may become \ninsufficient to perform a reliable analysis. This is a frequent challenge for the actuary. In \u201cAn \nIntroduction to Credibility Theory,\u201d Longley-Cook states: \n \nWe may liken our statistics to a large crumbly loaf cake, which we may cut in \nslices to obtain easily edible helpings. The method of slicing may be chosen in \ndifferent ways \u2013 across the cake, lengthwise down the cake, or even in horizontal \nslices \u2013 but only one method of slicing may be used at a time. If we try to slice \nthe cake more than one way at a time, we shall be left with a useless collection of \ncrumbs.14 \n \nConsider automobile accident benefits coverage15 as an example of how actuaries must decide \nhow to divide the cake. Options include analyzing the claims in total or breaking out the claims \ninto the individual components (e.g., medical/rehabilitation, disability income, death benefits, \nfuneral services, and supplementary benefits). Certainly, the claims behavior is very different for \nfuneral services claims than it is for medical/rehabilitation claims. There are differences in claims", "type": "Document"}}
