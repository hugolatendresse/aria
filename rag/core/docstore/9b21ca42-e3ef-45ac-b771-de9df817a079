The benefit of Johnson\u2019s approach is that it only requires the actuary to \nestimate the relative amount of resources required for each transaction type and does not \nrequire the actuary to perform detailed time-and-motion studies to calculate the actual cash \ncost of each transaction type. \n \nThe mechanics of the Johnson technique involve estimating the ULAE cost per claim activity \nby calculating weighted claim counts (using the relative transaction costs as weights) based on \nhistorical data and comparing those weighted claim counts to the total ULAE costs in the same \nhistorical period. In this technique, we then obtain the estimate of unpaid ULAE by projecting \nthe number of, and the ULAE cost associated with, weighted claim counts at each subsequent \nyear-end, related only to claims occurring prior to the reserve valuation date. \n \n \nMango-Allen Claim Staffing Technique \n \nMango and Allen introduce a claim staffing technique to respond to shortcomings they \nobserved in the Johnson method.107 They state that the technique is closer to a \u201ctransaction-\nbased method.\u201d They calculate estimated unpaid ULAE using future claim staff workload \nlevels and a new projection base, which is equal to the sum of calendar year opened, closed, \nand pending claims (OCP claims). \nActuaries using the claim staffing technique project the following four components: \n \n\uf0b7 Future calendar year OCP claims \n\uf0b7 Future calendar year claim staff workloads, which are expressed as OCP claims per staff \nmember \n\uf0b7 Future calendar year claim staff count \n\uf0b7 Future calendar year ULAE per claim staff member \n \nFuture calendar year ULAE payments, which include consideration of inflation, are equal to \nthe product of future claim staff count and future ULAE per claim staff member.
