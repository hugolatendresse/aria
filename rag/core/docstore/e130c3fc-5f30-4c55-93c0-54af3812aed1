This data review may include the following components: \n \n\uf0be Consistency with financial statement data \u2013 Can the actuary reconcile the data with financial \nstatement data (that may be subject to some form of external audit)?  \n \n\uf0be Consistency with prior data \u2013 Is the current data consistent with the data used in the prior \nanalysis? If not, why? \n \n\uf0be Data reasonableness \u2013 Are there certain values that appear questionable, such as large \nnegative paid claims or apparent inconsistencies between data elements? Questionable values \nare not always incorrect values, but the actuary should generally investigate questionable \nvalues before using them, especially if material to the analysis. \n \n\uf0be Data definitions \u2013 Does the actuary know how each of the data items is defined? The actuary \nshould make a reasonable effort to determine the definition of each data element used in the \nanalysis rather than assuming a certain definition given the label or name assigned to the \nelement. As discussed earlier, similar labels do not always imply similar definitions. The \nactuary may also need to know what the default values are for certain items. If the default is \nused too often in the absence of true information for that element, the data element may not \nbe sufficiently reliable for analysis purposes.   \n \n37", "type": "Document"}}
