We incorporate actuarial judgment by selecting two different \nclaim ratios to reflect the change in experience that is apparent between the older accident years and \nthe more recent accident years. (See Column (10) of Exhibit II, Sheet 1.) \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheet 2, we calculate the estimated IBNR and the total unpaid claim estimate. \nEstimated IBNR in Column (6) is equal to the expected claims in Column (4) less reported claims \nin Column (2). We then calculate the total unpaid claim estimate as the difference between \nexpected claims and paid claims or the sum of case outstanding plus IBNR. It is interesting to \nnote that in this example the estimated IBNR is negative for accident years 2000, 2001, and 2003. \nWhile negative IBNR is possible, particularly for first-party lines of insurance that are subject to \nsalvage and subrogation recoveries, it is not intuitively likely for U.S. Industry Auto. Remember \nthat the key assumption of the expected claims method is that total claims are a function of an a \npriori estimate and not actual claims activity to date. At times this is a strength of the expected \nclaims method and at times, such as in this example, it proves to be a weakness of the method.  \n \nThe negative IBNR suggests that the selected a priori claim ratio may be too low for certain \naccident years. An alternative approach that avoids a negative IBNR is to use the 65% claim ratio \nassumption for only accident years 2005 through 2007 and to rely on the estimated claim ratios in \nColumn (10) for all prior years (i.e., accident years 1998 through 2004). In other words, limit the \nuse of the expected claims method to accident years 2005 through 2007. Since the expected claims \nunreported and unpaid for the older years are relatively low, the claim development methods are \nlikely reliable projection methods.
