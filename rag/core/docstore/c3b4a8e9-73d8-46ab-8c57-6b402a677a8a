This assumption sometimes does not hold in \nreality and therefore using calendar year data to measure trend can cause over or underestimation of the \ntrend.  The problem with calendar year data is that claims (or losses) in any calendar year may have come \nfrom older accident years, yet they are matched to the most recent calendar year exposures (or claims).  A \nchange in exposure levels changes the distribution of each calendar year\u2019s claims by accident year. \nThe solution is to attempt to match the risk with the appropriate exposure.  One alternative mentioned \npreviously is to use econometric techniques or generalized linear models to measure trend.  This will \nabsorb changes in the size of the portfolio as well as changes in the mix of business.  Another approach is \nto measure the trend using accident year data (in lieu of calendar year data).  This is often done in \ncommercial lines trend analysis even when the portfolio size is not changing dramatically\u2014merely \nbecause the calendar year results are unreliable for trend purposes.  The accident year losses (or claim \ncounts) need to be developed to ultimate before measuring the trend, which introduces some subjectivity \ninto the trend analysis.   \nAnother alternative is to analyze the trend in incremental calendar year frequencies or severities.  This \ninvolves splitting each calendar year\u2019s claim counts (or paid losses) by accident year and matching them \nto the exposures (or claim counts) that produced them.  For example, assume Calendar Year 2010 has \npaid losses on claims from Accident Years 2010, 2009, and 2008.  The Calendar Year 2010 frequency is \nthe sum of all paid claim counts in Calendar Year 2010 divided by Calendar Year 2010 exposures.  The \nalternative approach sums three incremental Calendar Year 2010 frequencies:", "type": "Document"}}
