This also holds when \nexamining pure premium data. \nWhen using inflation-sensitive exposure bases, the inflationary pressure on the exposure can mask part or \nall of the change in the likelihood of claims occurring.  This makes it difficult to understand how the loss \ncomponents are changing over time.  In order to remove the effect of the changing exposure, the actuary \nmay choose to examine historical frequencies (or pure premiums) that have been adjusted for exposure \ntrend (i.e., the denominator has been adjusted by the exposure trend).  This frequency trend adjusted for \nchanges in exposure is combined with the severity trend to form a pure premium trend, which is then \napplied to historical losses (which have been or will be adjusted for loss development, benefit changes, \nextraordinary loss provisions, etc.) to project them into the period for which rates will be in effect.  To \nmaintain consistency, this projected loss measure needs to be compared to exposures that have been \nprojected to future levels using the selected exposure trend.   \nWhen deriving a loss ratio indication, it is also important to maintain consistency among the \ncomponents.  Some actuaries examine patterns in historical adjusted loss ratios.  This is the ratio of losses", "type": "Document"}}
