The exposure standard is calculated by dividing the number of claims \nneeded for full credibility by the expected frequency.   \nThe following table shows the number of claims and exposures needed for full credibility using example \nvalues for k and p: \n \nIf the actuary rejects the assumption that there is no variation in the size of losses, the number of claims \nneeded for observed data to be considered fully credible is as follows: \n \n \n \nRemoving the other simplifying assumptions will also alter the calculation for the full credibility \nstandard; appropriate derivations and formulae are beyond the scope of this text.
