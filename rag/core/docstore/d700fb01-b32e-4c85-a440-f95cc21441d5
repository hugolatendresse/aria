Thus, the expected claims technique generates an appropriate \nestimate of IBNR in a steady-state environment. This is also true of the development technique in \na steady-state environment. We present detailed calculations for this scenario in the top section of \nExhibit IV, Sheet 1. \n \n \nScenario 2 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim Ratios \n \nA weakness of the expected claims method is its lack of responsiveness to actual claims \nexperience. The projected value of ultimate claims will only change if the actuary changes the \nexpected claim ratio assumption. Thus, in Scenario 2, unless the actuary changes the 70% \nexpected claim ratio assumption, the projected ultimate claims will be unchanged from Scenario \n1. Since claims are increasing in Scenario 2, the estimated IBNR will be lower than the actual \nIBNR requirements if the actuary estimates unpaid claims using the expected claims method \nwithout a revision in the expected claim ratios. This example is particularly severe and it is highly \nunlikely that an actuary would proceed with this method without a significant change to the claim \nratio.   \n \nOne simple test to assess the adequacy of the expected claim ratio is to compare the reported \nclaim ratio to date to the selected claim ratio. Such a comparison may have alerted the actuary to \nthe fact that for accident years 2004 through 2008, the reported claim ratios are already greater \nthan the expected claim ratio. This simple test would suggest a higher expected claim ratio for \nmore recent accident years and avoid the negative values for IBNR seen in Column (6) of Exhibit \nIV, Sheet 1 (bottom section). \n \n \nScenario 3 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Case Outstanding Strength", "type": "Document"}}
