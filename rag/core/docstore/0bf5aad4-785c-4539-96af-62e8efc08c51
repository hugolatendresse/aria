(See Exhibit III, Sheet 4.) For U.S. workers \ncompensation, the most common exposure base is payroll (in hundreds of dollars). Our goal is to \ndetermine the appropriate frequency (i.e., number of claims per exposure unit) for the latest two \naccident years. Since payroll is an inflation-sensitive exposure base, we must adjust the payroll \nfor each accident year to a common time period. For simplification purposes, we assume a 2.5% \nannual inflation rate for payroll for all years in the experience period and trend all historical \npayroll to the cost level of accident year 2008. (Columns (5) through (7) of Exhibit III, Sheet 4, \ncontain these calculations.) \n \nSimilarly, the claim counts should be adjusted using trend factors to reflect changes in counts. \nIdeally, the actuary can analyze the self-insurer\u2019s own historical experience to determine the \nfrequency trend rate. In our example, however, sufficient historical data is not available. Thus, we \nrely on our knowledge of U.S. workers compensation in general and the specific industry of this \n202", "type": "Document"}}
