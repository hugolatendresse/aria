For example, a \ncatastrophic event may only affect one territory.  Similarly, one extraordinary loss only impacts one level.  \nConsequently, the actuary should consider replacing these actual losses with an average expected figure \nfor each level, if such data is available. \nThe following table shows the pure premium calculations for the simple example:", "type": "Document"}}
