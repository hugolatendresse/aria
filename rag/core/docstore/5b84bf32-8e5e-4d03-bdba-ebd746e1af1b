Considering Calendar \nYear 2011, there are three areas:  the area representing earned premium on policies written after \nJanuary 1, 2010 and prior to the July 1, 2010 rate change (area of rate level group 1 in Calendar \nYear 2011), the area representing earned premium on policies written on or after July 1, 2010 and before \nJanuary 1, 2011 (area of rate level group 2 in Calendar Year 2011), and the area representing earned \npremium on policies written on or after January 1, 2011 and before January 1, 2012 (area of rate level \ngroup 3 in Calendar Year 2011).  Simple geometry,14 as well as the assumption that the distribution of \npolicies written is uniform over time, is used to calculate the portion of the square represented by each \nrate level area.  For example, area 1 in Calendar Year 2011 is a triangle with area equal to \u00bd x base x \nheight.  The base and height are both six months (January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011) so the area (in \nmonths) is 18 (= \u00bd x 6 x 6).  This area\u2019s portion of the entire calendar year square is 0.125 (=18 / (12 x \n12)).  The math is simplified if restating the base and height as portions of a year (0.125 = \u00bd x \u00bd x \u00bd).  \nAlso, some areas (e.g., area 2 in Calendar Year 2011) are easier to calculate as one minus the sum of the \nremaining areas.  The areas of the three rate levels in Calendar Year 2011 are summarized below: \n\uf0b7 Area 1 in CY 2011:   0.125 = 0.50 x 0.50 x 0.50 \n\uf0b7 Area 2 in CY 2011:   0.375 = 1.00 - (0.125 + 0.500)  \n\uf0b7 Area 3 in CY 2011:   0.500 = 0.50 x 1.00 x 1.00 \n \n                                                      \n14 The following geometric formulae may be used in the parallelogram method: \nArea of a triangle:  \u00bd x base x height \nArea of a parallelogram:  base x height \nArea of a trapezoid:  \u00bd x (base1 + base 2) x height \n50%\n0%\n100%\n% of Policy \nEarned", "type": "Document"}}
