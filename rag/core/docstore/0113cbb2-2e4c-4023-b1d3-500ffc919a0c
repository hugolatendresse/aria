If a regional or nationwide carrier considers the variation to be material, the \ncompany should try to collect data at a finer level and make the appropriate adjustments.  Once again, the \ncost of the data collection should be balanced against the additional accuracy gained.   \nThird, some expenses that are considered fixed actually vary by certain characteristics.  For example, \nfixed expenses may vary between new and renewal business.  This only affects the overall statewide rate \nlevel indication if the distribution of risks for that characteristic is either changing dramatically or varies \nsignificantly by state, or both.  Even if there is no impact on the overall rate level indication, any material \nfixed expense cost difference not reflected in the rates will impact the equity of the two groups.  To make \nrates equitable for the example of new versus renewal business, material differences in new and renewal \nprovisions should be reflected with consideration given to varying persistency levels as described by \nSholom Feldblum in \u201cPersonal Automobile Premiums:  An Asset Share Pricing Approach for Property/ \nCasualty Insurers\u201d (Feldblum 1996). \nFinally, the existence of economies of scale in a changing book may lead to increasing or decreasing \nprojected average fixed expense figures.  Further studies may reveal techniques for better approximating \nthe relationship between changes in exposures/policies and expenses to assist in capturing the impact of \neconomies of scale.  Until then, internal expense trend data and actuarial judgment should suffice for \nincorporating the impact of economies of scale.  \nTRENDING\tEXPENSES\t\nThere is an expectation that expenses, like most monetary values, will change over time due to \ninflationary pressures and other factors.", "type": "Document"}}
