In the examples presented for XYZ Insurer in previous chapters, we refer to the \nexperience of one particular line of insurance. In estimating unpaid ULAE, we use the experience \nfor the insurer as a whole (i.e., all lines of coverage combined). For this example, we are fortunate \nto have five years of complete and accurate data. We are somewhat surprised to observe relatively \nstable ULAE ratios given all the changes we know transpired at XYZ Insurer during the \nexperience period. We select a ULAE ratio of 0.045 based on a review of the historical \nexperience as well as discussions with company management regarding their expectations for the \nfuture. These discussions included expectations regarding claims department caseload, the \nrelationship between claim and salary inflation, as well as management\u2019s expectations of the \nfuture use of independent adjusters and TPAs. \n \nFor XYZ Insurer, case outstanding at December 31, 2008 is $603 million and selected IBNR is \n$316 million. Using the classical technique, we estimate unpaid ULAE at December 31, 2008 to \nbe $27.8 million.
