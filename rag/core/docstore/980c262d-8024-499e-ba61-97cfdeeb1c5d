Losses on accidents occurring during the year are compared to premium earned on policies \nduring the same year.  Since accident year is not closed (fixed) at the end of the year, however, future \ndevelopment on those known losses needs to be estimated.  Selecting a valuation date several months \nafter the end of the year allows the emergence of some development in the data and therefore may \nimprove estimation of ultimate losses.   \nPolicy year aggregation, which is sometimes referred to as underwriting year, considers all premium and \nloss transactions on policies that were written during a twelve-month period, regardless of when the claim \noccurred or when it was reported, reserved, or paid.  All premium and exposures earned on policies \nwritten during the year are considered part of that policy year\u2019s earned premium and earned exposures.  \nPremium and exposures are not fixed until after the expiration date of all policies written during the year.  \nPolicy year paid losses include payments made on those claims covered by policies written during the \nyear.  Similarly, reported losses for the policy year consist of payments made plus case reserves only for \nthose claims covered by policies written during the year.  At the end of the policy year, losses can and \noften do change as additional claims occur, claims are paid, or reserves are changed.  \nPolicy year aggregation represents the best match between losses and premium.  Losses on policies \nwritten during the year are compared with premium earned on those same policies.  Given that policy year \nexposures are not fully earned until after the end of the year (e.g., policy year exposures for a product \nwith an annual policy term are not fully earned until 24 months after the start of the policy year), data \ntakes longer to develop than both calendar year and accident year.", "type": "Document"}}
