For example, the number of claims associated \nwith claims occurring in a particular accident year will often increase from one valuation point to \nanother until all claims are reported. There are circumstances, however, when the number of \nclaims decreases from one valuation point to another. In Chapter 11, we use an example with data \nfor private passenger automobile collision coverage organized by accident half-year. The claim \ncount data excludes claims closed without payment. In this particular example, we will observe \nthat the number of claims decreases at successive valuations. Reported claim development can \nalso show downward patterns if the insurer settles claims for a lower value than the case \noutstanding estimate or if the insurer includes recoveries with the claims data. \n \nThe development triangle is one of the most common tools that actuaries use to organize data in \norder to identify and analyze patterns in historical data. Actuaries use development triangles to \nquantify historical development. Development patterns are critical inputs to many techniques \nused to estimate unpaid claims. In this chapter, we demonstrate how to build development \ntriangles for paid claims, case outstanding, reported claims, and reported claim counts. We use \npayment and case outstanding information for a sample of 15 claims over a four-year time \nhorizon. Our example is not representative of any particular line of insurance. Its sole purpose is \nto demonstrate how to build development triangles based on detailed claims information. \n \n \nRows, Diagonals, and Columns \n \nTable 3 contains a sample reported claim triangle for an organization that began operations in \n2005.  \n \nTable 3 \u2013 Reported Claim Triangle \nAccident Reported Claims as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 \n2005 1,500 2,420 2,720 3,020 \n2006 1,150 1,840 2,070  \n2007 1,650 2,640   \n2008 1,740", "type": "Document"}}
