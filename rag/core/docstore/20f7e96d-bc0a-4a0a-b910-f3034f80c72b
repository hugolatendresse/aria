There may also be less time available to process and close the November and \nDecember claims due to the shorter work period for many companies that close over the \nChristmas holidays. The actuary should speak to claims department management to understand \nthe reasons for such patterns in the data. We also observe that there are no material differences or \npatterns evident in any maturities beyond six months. \n \nSince we observe a distinctive pattern in the ratio of closed-to-reported claim counts at six \nmonths, the next step is to see if we can discern any patterns in either the closed count triangle or \nthe reported count triangle or both. Upon a second examination of the age-to-age factors for \nclosed claim counts (Part 2 of Exhibit I, Sheet 1), we note differences in the age-to-age factors for \naccident half-years ending June versus December. We do not see obvious patterns in the reported \nclaim count triangle at the 6-to-12 month interval. In the table below we summarize the 6-to-12 \nmonth factors for both closed and reported counts. We also present the simple averages for all \nyears and the latest three years. \n \n Age-to-Age Factors at 6-12 Months \n \nAccident Half-Year \nClosed Claim \nCounts \nReported Claim \nCounts \n2003-2 1.281 0.932 \n2004-1 1.153 0.934 \n2004-2 1.275 0.910 \n2005-1 1.154 0.956 \n2005-2 1.327 0.942 \n2006-1 1.181 0.966 \n2006-2 1.353 0.956 \n2007-1 1.212 0.983 \n2007-2 1.312 0.995 \n   \nAccident Half-Years \u2013 1   \nSimple Average All Years 1.175 0.960 \nSimple Average Latest 3 Years 1.183 0.968 \n   \nAccident Half-Years \u2013 2   \nSimple Average All Years 1.310 0.947 \nSimple Average Latest 3 Years 1.331 0.964", "type": "Document"}}
