The first column of the table is a claim ID number. The next two columns are the accident \ndate and the report date. The accident date is necessary for determining the appropriate row of the \ntriangle. The report date is important for determining when the information about the claim first \nenters the triangle. The table includes claim payments made in the year and the ending case \noutstanding value. It is important to recognize that the claim payments in the table do not \nrepresent the cumulative paid values but the transactional payments made during the year. The \ncase outstanding values contained in the table are the ending case outstanding values; they are not \nthe transactional change in case outstanding that occurred during the year.  \n \nIt is absolutely critical when constructing claim development triangles that the actuary fully \nunderstands the data available. The information systems used by different insurers vary \ntremendously. Thus, the types and format of data available to actuaries vary significantly from \ninsurer to insurer. Defining and understanding the available data must be the first step in any \nactuarial analysis.  \n \n \nStep-by-Step Example \n \nWe now demonstrate, step by step, how to create the paid claims, case outstanding, reported \nclaims, and reported claim count triangles. We begin with the incremental paid claim \ndevelopment triangle. Table 6 below summarizes the payment transactions presented in our \nexample.
