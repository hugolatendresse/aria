The average date of premium earned in the \nprojected policy year period is December 31, 2013.  The trend period is still 2.5 years as each date was \nshifted by the same amount.  Subsequent paragraphs in this chapter will refer to the first method of \nderiving premium trend length. \nThere are a few conditions that can affect the length of the premium trend period.  First, if the actuary is \nreviewing policies that have a term other than 12 months, the average written date of policies earning in \nthe calendar year (the \u201ctrend from\u201d date) will be different than discussed above.  For example, if the \npolicies in the prior example were six-month policies, then the \u201ctrend from\u201d date is April 1, 2011.  The \naverage written date of policies in the projection period (the \u201ctrend to\u201d date) is unchanged (June 30, \n2013), and the trend length is 2.25 years. \n \n50%\n0%\n100%\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n5.26 Trend Period for 12-month Terms\nCY 11 PY 13\n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13 1/1/14 1/1/15\nPremium Trend Factor\n1/1/11 6/30/13\nWritten Dates for CY11 Earned Premium Written Dates for \nPY13 EP\n50%\n0%\n100%\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n5.27 Trend Period for 1-Step Trending with 6-Month Policies\nCY 11 PY 13\n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13 1/1/14 1/1/15\nPremium Trend Factor\n4/1/11 6/30/13\nWritten Dates for CY11 Earned \nPremium \nWritten Dates for \nPY13 EP", "type": "Document"}}
