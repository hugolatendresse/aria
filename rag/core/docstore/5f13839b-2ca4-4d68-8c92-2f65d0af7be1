In such a case, it is customary for the practitioner \nto treat all policies as if they were written at the mid-point of the period (such as the 15th of the month for \nmonthly data); this practice is often referred to as the \u201c15th of the month\u201d rule.  This is a good \napproximation as long as policies are written uniformly during each time period.  If this approach is \napplied to longer periods (e.g., quarters or years), the assumption of uniform writings is less likely to be \nreasonable.  This rule was discussed in detail in Chapter 4. \nADJUSTMENTS\tTO\tPREMIUM\t\nIn order for historical premium to be useful in projecting future premium, it must first be brought to \ncurrent rate level.  The policies underlying the experience period may have been written using rates that \nare no longer in effect.  Adjustments need to be made to the historical premium for rate increases \n(decreases) that occurred during or after the historical experience period or the projected premium will be \nunderstated (overstated).  This is referred to as adjusting the premium \u201cto current rate level\u201d or putting the \npremium \u201con-level.\u201d  Two current rate level methods, extension of exposures and the parallelogram \nmethod, are described in detail in this section. \nIn addition to a current rate level adjustment, historical premium must be developed to ultimate.
