(See middle section of Exhibit I, Sheet 4.) Again, we use examples to \ndemonstrate the calculations. To project the 2000 accident year incremental payments for 120 \nmonths (i.e., the interval 108 to 120 months is labeled 120 months in the exhibit), we multiply the \n0.524 selected ratio at 120 months by the case outstanding at 108 months ($205,370 x 0.524 = \n$107,614). Similarly, accident year 2006 incremental paid claims at 48 months of $4,459,444 are \nequal to the selected ratio at 48 months of 0.714 multiplied by the case outstanding at 36 months \nof $6,245,721. \n \nThe highlighted cells represent the projected values; the others values are from the original data \ntriangles for U.S. Industry Auto. \n \nAt the bottom of Exhibit I, Sheet 4, we calculate cumulative paid claims. The projected ultimate \nclaims are equal to the last column of the cumulative paid claims. (Ultimate claims are also \nsummarized in Column (4) of Exhibit I, Sheet 5.) We calculate estimated IBNR and the total \nunpaid claim estimate in Exhibit I, Sheet 5 in the same manner as that presented in the preceding \nchapters. Estimated IBNR is equal to projected ultimate claims minus reported claims, and the \ntotal unpaid claim estimate is equal to projected ultimate claims less paid claims. We suggest that \nyou compare the results of the case outstanding development method with the reported and paid \nclaim development projections from Chapter 7. \n \n \nXYZ Insurer \n \nWe present the example for XYZ Insurer in Exhibit II, Sheets 1 through 5; these exhibits follow \nthe exact same format as Exhibit I.
