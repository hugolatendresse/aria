While some \nactuaries at very large companies may perform detailed analyses of unpaid claims on a quarterly \nbasis, many use \u201croll-forward\u201d types of analyses to capture and compare actual claims with \nexpected claims between complete, detailed analyses. In addition to measuring changes in claims \nfor historical periods, the actuary must incorporate the effect of changes in the exposure for the \ncurrent period to any changes in the unpaid claim estimate used for financial reporting purposes. \n \nComparisons of actual-to-expected claims are valuable so that the actuary can understand the \nappropriateness of prior selections and make revisions as necessary if actual claims do not emerge \nas expected. Monitoring unpaid claims can be important for insurers from a financial reporting \nperspective, for budgeting and planning purposes, for pricing and other strategic decision-making, \nand for planning for the next complete analysis of unpaid claims.  \n \nIt is typically a simple exercise to develop a model that allows comparisons of actual and \nexpected claims by accident year between successive annual valuations. We present an example \nof such a model in Exhibit IV. For DC Insurer, we derive ultimate claims at December 31, 2007 \nbased on the reported claim development technique. In Exhibit IV, Sheet 3, we use the selected \nultimate claims and the selected reporting pattern to compare actual reported claims one year later \n(i.e., December 31, 2008) with our expected claims for the year.  \n \nFor each accident year, expected reported claims in the calendar year are equal to: \n \n  [(ultimate claims selected at December 31, 2007 \u2013 actual reported claims at December 31, 2007)  \n    / (% unreported at December 31, 2007)] x (% reported at December 31, 2008 - % reported at \n    December 31, 2007)", "type": "Document"}}
