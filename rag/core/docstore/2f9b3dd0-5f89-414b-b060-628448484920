Using three-year historical expense ratios \nincreases the impact of these premium changes by increasing the amount of time between the historical \nand projected periods.  A potential solution for this is to trend the historical premium to prospective \nlevels, as was discussed in Chapter 5.   \nThird, the Premium-based Projection Method can create inequitable rates for regional or nationwide \ncarriers if countrywide expense ratios25 are used and applied to state projected premium to determine the \nexpected fixed expenses.  This is essentially allocating fixed expenses to each state based on premium.  \nThe average premium level in states can vary due to overall loss cost differences (e.g., coastal states tend \nto have higher overall homeowners loss costs) as well as distributional differences (e.g., some states have \na significantly higher average amount of insurance than other states).  If significant variation exists in \naverage rates across the states, a disproportionate share of projected fixed expenses will be allocated to \nthe higher-than-average premium states.  Thus, the estimated fixed expenses will be overstated in higher-\nthan-average premium states and understated in the lower-than-average average premium states.  If a \ncompany tracks fixed expenses by state and calculates fixed expense ratios for each state, then this \ndistortion will not exist.     \nReturn to the simple example outlined at the onset of the chapter.  Assuming the historical fixed expense \nratio was calculated at a time that the average premium level was $200 rather than $250, then the \nhistorical expense ratio is 10% (= $20 / $200) rather than 8% (= $20 / $250).  If the 10% is applied to the \npremium at current rate level, the projected dollars of fixed expense will be $25 (=$10% x $250).  \nConsequently, the overall indicated average premium will be overstated:", "type": "Document"}}
