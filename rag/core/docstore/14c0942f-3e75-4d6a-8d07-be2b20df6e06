The details will not be discussed in this chapter, but will be revisited in Chapters 5 and 6.  \nSUMMARY\t\nExposures are the basic unit used to measure risk.  As such, the rate is defined as a price per unit of \nexposure.  The exposure base used for a particular insurance product should be proportional to loss and \npractical to use.  Furthermore, it is desirable that the exposure base used is consistent over time.    \nExposures can be categorized as written, in-force, earned, or unearned and aggregated according to \ncalendar year or policy year.  Written exposure refers to the number of exposures associated with policies \nwritten during a specified period of time.  In-force exposure refers to the number of exposures associated \nwith all policies that are in effect on a given date.  Earned exposure is the portion of the written exposure \nthat corresponds to the portion of the policy period that has already expired.  Unearned exposure is the \nportion of the written exposure that corresponds to the remaining or unexpired portion of the policy.  The \nactual exposure used depends on the analysis being performed.  When policy data is pre-summarized at \nthe quarterly or monthly level, exposures are approximated by assuming each policy is written at the mid-\npoint of the period (e.g., the \u201c15th of the month\u201d rule for monthly data).  Finally, when using inflation-\nsensitive exposure bases, it may be necessary to project future exposure levels, and this will be discussed \nfurther in subsequent chapters.", "type": "Document"}}
