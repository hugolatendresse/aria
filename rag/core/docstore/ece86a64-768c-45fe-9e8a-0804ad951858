All else being equal, renewal customers tend to be \nless expensive to service and generate fewer losses on average than new business customers. \nConsequently, retention ratios and changes in the retention rate are monitored closely by marketing \ndepartments as companies generally want to retain as many profitable customers as possible.   \nCare should be taken to understand the data used to calculate the retention ratio.  For example, if \nCompany A excludes from the calculation all policies that were non-renewed by the company (i.e., the \ncompany canceled the policy as it no longer met the eligibility criteria), and Company B includes them, \nthen Company A will have a better retention ratio than Company B, all else being equal.   \nAnalysts study both the absolute ratios and changes in the close and retention ratios.  As price is a major \ndeterminant of customer buying decisions, companies frequently rely on close ratios and retention ratios \nas primary signals of the competitiveness of rates for new business and renewal customers, respectively.  \nChanges in these ratios are often used to gauge changes in competitiveness.  Companies also scrutinize \nclose ratios and retention ratios when rate changes are implemented.  Rate changes affect renewal \nbusiness directly, and any change from the status quo can motivate existing customers to shop for \ninsurance elsewhere.  Rate changes also influence the company\u2019s competitive position, which is", "type": "Document"}}
