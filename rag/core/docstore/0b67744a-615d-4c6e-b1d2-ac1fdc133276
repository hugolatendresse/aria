For claims at these older maturities, we expect that \nthe claims department has complete information and thus the case outstanding amounts for these \nclaims are adequate. This is an example of how actuarial judgment influences the application of a \nmechanical projection methodology for a specific insurer. \n \nWe analyze the adjusted reported claim development triangle (case adjustment only) in Exhibit \nIII, Sheet 3. At the 12-to-24 month interval, we observe a persistent downward trend in the age-\nto-age factors. A similar pattern, though not quite as pronounced, also exists at 24 months. This \nleads us to question whether or not the trend rate is appropriate, particularly for these two \nmaturity ages. We also return to an issue raised earlier about a potential shift in the type of claim \nthat is now closed at 12 and 24 months. This could have a distorting effect on this projection \nmethodology.  \n \nWe select claim development factors based on the volume-weighted three-year average to \nrecognize the decreasing age-to-age factors in the most recent diagonals. We compare the \nestimated average age-to-age factors with our selected factors based on the unadjusted reported \nclaim triangle (from Chapter 7). As expected, the estimated average age-to-age factors for most \nmaturities are less than those based on the unadjusted claims. This is consistent with our \nexpectation since we believe that case outstanding strengthening has occurred at XYZ Insurer; \nthus, an unadjusted reported claim development method would likely result in an overstated \nestimate of unpaid claims. When selecting claim development factors, we rely on the latest three-\nyear volume-weighted average for ages 12-to-24, 24-to-36, and 36-to-48. We judgmentally select \n291", "type": "Document"}}
