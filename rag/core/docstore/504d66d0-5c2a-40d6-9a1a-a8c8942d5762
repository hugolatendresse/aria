When this occurs, the actuary must estimate how the premium will \ndevelop to ultimate.  Common scenarios include when an actuary is using an incomplete year of data or \nwhen the line of business uses premium audits. \nActuaries try to balance stability and responsiveness when determining the data to be used for a \nratemaking analysis.  At times, the actuary may feel it is prudent to use a year that is not yet complete; \nthis is more common for policy year analysis due to the long time it takes for the policy year to close.       \nAssume a ratemaking analysis is performed on policy year data before all policies written in that year \nhave expired (e.g., Policy Year 2011 as of December 31, 2011).  While the actuary knows which policies \nhave been written, the actuary does not know which policies may have changes or be cancelled during the \npolicy term.  Thus, the actuary must estimate how premium will develop to ultimate.  Typically this is \ndone by analyzing historical patterns of premium development to better understand the effect of \ncancelations and mid-term amendments on the policy year premium.   \nAnother example of premium development occurs in lines that utilize premium audits.  Typically, the \ninsured will pay premium based on an estimate of the total exposure.  Once the policy period is completed \nand the actual exposure is known, the final premium is calculated.  For example, workers compensation \npremium depends on payroll and the final workers compensation premium is determined by payroll audits", "type": "Document"}}
