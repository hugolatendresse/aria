If the aggregate dollars spent are consistent with dollars expected to be spent on similar non-recurring \nprojects in the future, then the expense ratios should be similar and no adjustment is warranted.  However, \nif the expense item represents an extraordinary expense, then the actuary must decide to what extent it \nshould be reflected in the rates.  For example, assume the extraordinary expense is from a major project to \nimprove the automated policy issuance process.  The actuary may decide to reflect the expense in the \nrates.  Assuming the new system will be used for a significant length of time, it may be appropriate to \ndampen the impact of the item by spreading the expense over a period of several years.  On the other \nhand, if the actuary decides not to reflect the expense in the rates, the expense is basically funded by \nexisting surplus.    \nFinally, a few states place restrictions on which expenses can be included when determining rates.  The \nscenario above regarding whether an extraordinary expense benefits the policyholder is one such \nexample.
