Column 10 is the present value of the premium, taking \ncumulative persistency into account as well.  Column 11 is the ratio of Column 9 to Column 10; profit as \na percentage of premium is a commonly used profit measure. \nBased on the percentage profit over a one-year time horizon (i.e., the first row in each table), a 70-year-\nold is more profitable to insure than a 22-year-old.
