In the bottom section of \nExhibit IV, Sheet 2, we observe that the Cape Cod method produces estimated IBNR that is lower \nthan the actual IBNR. Even though reported claims are increasing in this scenario when compared \nto the prior scenario, there are also changes in the reporting pattern. Thus, the Cape Cod method \nis not responding appropriately to the changing product mix. Detailed calculations are contained \nwithin the bottom section of Exhibit IV, Sheets 1 and 2. \n179", "type": "Document"}}
