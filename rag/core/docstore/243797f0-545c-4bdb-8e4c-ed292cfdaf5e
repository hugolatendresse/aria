Conger and Nolibos note that although this technique presumes a steady state, it \ncan be refined to reflect volume growth as well as the effects of inflation.  \n \nA third technique is the construction of paid ULAE triangles based on time and motion studies. \nFor example, assume that time and motion studies suggest that 50% of ULAE is paid at the time a \nclaim is reported and the remaining 50% is paid in proportion to claim payments. An actuary can \nthen assign historical calendar ULAE to accident year-calendar year cohorts: 50% according to \nthe distribution of reported claims across current accident year, prior accident year, second prior \naccident year, and so on; and 50% according to the distribution of paid claims, as indicated by an \nappropriate accident year claims payment pattern. Once the ULAE triangle is constructed, the \nactuary can apply the traditional development technique to estimate ultimate ULAE and indicated \nunpaid ULAE. \n \nWhile triangular methods can theoretically be used to project ultimate ULAE and indicated \nunpaid expenses, in practice, ULAE triangle projections are rarely used by actuaries. \n \n \n                                                 \n110 Proceedings of the IASA, 1968. \n406", "type": "Document"}}
