The actuary must understand why the estimated value of a reported claim \ncould vary over time and how changes in case outstanding are processed by an insurer. \n \n \nClaims Professionals \n \nThe claims professional, who is often referred to as a claims examiner or claims adjuster, can be \nan employee of the insurer or an employee of an organization external to the insurer. Large \ncommercial insurers generally maintain internal claims departments with many claims adjusters \nmanaging the claims. Small to mid-sized commercial insurers and self-insurers often hire third-\nparty claims administrators (TPAs) to handle a specific book of claims. TPAs frequently handle \nthe claims from beginning to end (i.e., from the initial report to the final payment). Insurers \nusually require the TPA to report details of the claims on a predetermined basis (e.g., monthly or \nquarterly). In certain circumstances, a TPA manages all the claims of an insurer, and the insurer \nonly has a minimal number of claims personnel reviewing the activities of the TPA. The \ncompensation for services of a TPA is generally based on a contract for the entire book of \nbusiness and not by individual claim, though compensation varies among TPAs.  \n                                                 \n10 The source of data is Best\u2019s Aggregates & Averages (2008 Edition), consolidated annual statement data \nfor the U.S. insurance industry.  \n17", "type": "Document"}}
