Thus, this is represented graphically using a \nparallelogram starting with a policy written on the first day of the policy year and ending with a policy \nwritten on the last day of the policy year:   \n \nAs can be seen clearly in the graph, the policy year assuming annual policies takes 24 months to \ncomplete.  In contrast, the calendar year premium is fixed after 12 months.  For that reason, most \nratemaking analysis focuses on premium data aggregated by calendar year (and losses are generally \naggregated on an accident year basis). \nIn addition to aggregating by calendar or policy year, premium can be defined in four basic ways:  written \npremium, earned premium, unearned premium, and in-force premium.   \nWritten premium is the total amount of premium for all policies written during the specified period.  In \nother words, the key in determining written premium is the inception date of the policy (i.e., the base of \neach line in the figure).  For example, the written premium for Calendar Year 2011 is the sum of the \npremium for all policies that had an effective date in 2011.  As can be seen in Figure 5.5, Policies B, C, D, \nand E all have effective dates in 2011 (shown as large circles on the horizontal axis), and their entire \npremium contributes to Calendar Year 2011 written premium.  In contrast, Policies A and F have \neffective dates in years 2010 and 2012, respectively, and do not contribute to Calendar Year 2011 written \npremium. \n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D EF\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n5.3 Calendar Year Aggregation\nCY 10 CY 11 CY 12\n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D E F\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n5.4 Policy Year Aggregation\nPY 10 PY 11 PY 12", "type": "Document"}}
