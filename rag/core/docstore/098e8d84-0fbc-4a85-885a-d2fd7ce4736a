This is commonly done by applying loss development factors to either paid or reported \nlosses and ALAE (discussed in detail in Chapter 6).  The expected losses, to which the projected ultimate \nlosses will be compared, also need to reflect an ultimate level.  If capped losses are used, then the loss \ndevelopment factors applied should be developed from data that has also been capped. \nFurther adjustments to the historical losses are needed if the basis of the experience rating formula is \nprojected ultimate losses at current exposure and dollar levels (i.e., the fourth method of comparison listed \nabove).  The adjustments should reflect economic and social inflation (e.g., changes in judicial decisions \nor litigiousness) as well as changes in risk characteristics (e.g., size and type of entity) and changes in \npolicy limits.  First, historical losses are developed to ultimate, trended to current cost levels, and summed \nacross the years.  This figure is then compared to the sum of historical exposures by year.  If the exposure \nbase is sensitive to inflation (e.g., payroll), the historical exposures should be trended to current levels and \nthen summed.  The ratio of trended ultimate losses to exposures at current level is then multiplied by a \ncurrent exposure measure.  Following is an illustration of this calculation:", "type": "Document"}}
