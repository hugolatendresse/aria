This complicates the use of the extension of exposures technique since it may be difficult to \ndetermine what debits and credits would be applied under today\u2019s schedule rating guidelines.  The actuary \nmay consider measuring how credit and debit practices have changed by reviewing distributions of debits \nand credits over recent years. \nParallelogram\tMethod\t\nThe parallelogram method, which is sometimes called the geometric method, is undertaken on a group of \npolicies and is less accurate than extension of exposures.  The method assumes that premium is written \nevenly throughout the time period, an assumption that should be evaluated with each analysis.  The \nparallelogram method involves adjusting the aggregated historical premium by an average factor to put \nthe premium on-level.
