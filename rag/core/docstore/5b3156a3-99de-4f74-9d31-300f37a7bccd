The refinement recognizes that ULAE payments \nfor a specific calendar year would not be expected to track perfectly with claim payments since \nactual ULAE is related to both the reporting and payment of claims. In contrast, the classical \ntechnique, by assuming a steady state, makes the implicit simplifying assumption that paid claims \nare approximately equal to reported claims, and thus the two quantities can be used \ninterchangeably.  \n \n \nKey Assumptions of Kittel Refinement \n \nKey assumptions of the Kittel refinement to the classical technique include: \n \n\uf0b7 ULAE is sustained as claims are reported even if no claim payments are made.  \n \n\uf0b7 ULAE payments for a specific calendar year are related to both the reporting and payment of \nclaims. \n \nThus, in the Kittel refinement to the classical technique, an insurer\u2019s ULAE-to-claim relationship \nis derived based on a review of the ratio of paid ULAE-to-the average of paid claims and \nincurred99 claims to determine a reasonable approximation of the relationship of ultimate ULAE-\nto-ultimate claims. In the Kittel refinement, calendar year incurred claims are defined to be \ncalendar year paid claims plus the change in total claim liabilities, including both case \noutstanding and IBNR. \n \nKittel derives his formula as follows: \n \nIf we use the 50/50 assumption and ignore partial payments, the loss dollars \nprocessed with the calendar year paid unallocated loss adjustment expenses are: \n \n\u00bd unit of work    x    payments on prior outstanding reserves \n1 complete unit    x    losses opened and paid during the year \n\u00bd unit of work    x    losses opened remaining open \n \nThe ratio of calendar year paid unallocated loss adjustment expense to the dollars", "type": "Document"}}
