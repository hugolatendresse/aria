This combination variable essentially replaces the original variables and thereby reduces the \nparameter estimates of the model. \nThis technique might be used in ratemaking to compress a long list of highly correlated variables into a \nscore variable (or a small number of uncorrelated score variables) that represents linear combinations of \nthe original variables.  For example, the vehicle symbols discussed earlier in this chapter may have been \nderived as a linear combination of correlated variables such as vehicle weight, vehicle height, number of \ncylinders, horsepower, cost when new, etc..  Another example is combining various geo-demographic \nvariables, which are variables describing average characteristics of an area (e.g., population density, \naverage proportion of home-ownership, average age of home, median number of rooms in the home, etc.) \nCluster\tAnalysis\t\nCluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis tool that seeks to combine small groups of similar risks \ninto larger homogeneous categories or \u201cclusters.\u201d  It generally aims to minimize the differences within a \ncategory and maximize the difference between categories. \nIn practice, cluster analysis is most commonly used in rating for geography.  Actuaries generally start \nwith small geographic units (such as postal code or zip code) that are often quite granular.  Cluster \nanalysis applies a collection of different algorithms to group these units into clusters based on historical \nexperience, modeled experience, or well-defined similarity rules.  This allows easier incorporation into \nGLMs. \nCART\t\nThe purpose of CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is to develop tree-building algorithms to \ndetermine a set of if-then logical conditions that help improve classification. \nIn personal automobile insurance, a resulting tree may start with an if-then condition around gender.  If \nthe risk is male, the tree then continues to another if-then condition around age.  If the risk is male and", "type": "Document"}}
