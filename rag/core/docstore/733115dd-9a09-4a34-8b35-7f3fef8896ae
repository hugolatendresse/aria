Actuaries also often rely on report year \ndevelopment triangles for the analysis of claims-made coverages such as U.S. medical malpractice \nand errors and omissions liability. Reinsurers often organize claims data by underwriting year. \nPolicy year is a similar concept to underwriting year. \n \nFor self-insurers, the policy year, fiscal year, and accident year are often the same. For example, a \nself-insured public entity with a fiscal year April 1 to March 31 may issue documents of coverage \nto covered departments and agencies with an April 1 to March 31 coverage period; such entity may \nalso arrange excess insurance with a policy year of April 1 to March 31. Finally, this public entity \nmay aggregate development triangles using accident year periods of April 1 to March 31.  \n \nClaims can be categorized by time intervals other than annual intervals. Actuaries also use \nmonthly, quarterly, and semi-annual data for developing estimates of unpaid claims. When \nselecting the time interval, important considerations for the actuary include the credibility of the \nexperience or the stability of development or both. \n \nThere are numerous possibilities for the types of claims data that are presented in development \ntriangles. Common types of data include: \n \n\uf0be Reported claims \n\uf0be Case outstanding \n\uf0be Cumulative total paid claims \n\uf0be Cumulative paid claims on closed claim counts26 \n\uf0be Incremental paid claims \n\uf0be Reported claim counts \n\uf0be Claim counts on closed with payment  \n\uf0be Claim counts on closed with no payment  \n\uf0be Total closed claim counts \n\uf0be Outstanding claim counts \n \nActuaries also use the data types listed previously to create triangles of ratios and average claim \nvalues. Examples of these triangles include:", "type": "Document"}}
