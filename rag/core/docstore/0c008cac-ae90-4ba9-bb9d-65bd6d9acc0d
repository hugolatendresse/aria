The unpaid claim estimate is \nthe result of the application of a particular estimation technique. For the same line of business and \nthe same experience period, different estimation techniques will likely generate different unpaid \nclaim estimates. In addition, the unpaid claim estimate will likely change from one valuation date \nto another for the same portfolio. The carried reserve for unpaid claims is the amount reported in \na published statement or in an internal statement of financial condition. \n  \nThe unpaid claims estimate includes five components: case outstanding on known claims, \nprovision for future development on known claims, estimate for reopened claims, provision for \nclaims incurred but not reported, and provision for claims in transit (i.e., claims reported but not \nrecorded). We use the terms case outstanding or unpaid case to refer to the estimates of unpaid \nclaims established by the claims department, third-party adjusters, or independent adjusters for \nknown and reported claims only; case outstanding do not include future development on reported \nclaims. Actuaries refer to the sum of the remaining four components (i.e., provision for future \ndevelopment on known claims, estimate for reopened claims, provision for claims incurred but \nnot reported, and provision for claims in transit) as the broad definition of incurred but not \nreported (IBNR). \n \nIBNR claims are often further separated into two components: \n \n\uf0be Incurred but not yet reported claims (pure IBNR or narrow definition of IBNR) \n\uf0be Incurred but not enough reported (IBNER, commonly referred to as development on known \nclaims) \n \nOne of the most important reasons for separating IBNR into its components is to test the", "type": "Document"}}
