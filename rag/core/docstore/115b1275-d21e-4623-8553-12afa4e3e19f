However, the same leveraging effect does not \nexist since expected claims, not actual claims, are the basis for determining unreported claims in \nthe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, and the expected claims did not change in our example. \n \n \nScenario 4 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim Ratios and Case Outstanding Strength \n \nWe present the detailed calculations for Scenario 4 in the bottom section of Exhibit III, Sheet 2. \nWe see that the estimated IBNR based on the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is \noverstated while the paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson projection is understated, absent a change in the \nexpected claims assumption.  \n \nFor both projections, the expected claims used in the example are too low. This is the reason that \nthe paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson method produces an estimate of IBNR that is $443,260 lower than \nthe actual IBNR. This is the same difference between estimated and actual IBNR that we saw in \nScenario 2, where claim ratios increased and case outstanding strength remained stable. Since the \npayment pattern is unaffected by changes in case outstanding adequacy, there is no effect on the \npaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. The sole reason for the inadequacy of the paid Bornhuetter-\nFerguson method is the understatement of expected claims. \n \nIn Scenario 2 (increasing claim ratios and stable case outstanding strength), we see that the \nreported Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique produces an estimated IBNR that is lower than the \nactual IBNR. In Scenario 3 (stable claim ratio and increasing case outstanding strength), the \nestimated IBNR based on the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is too high. These two \nfactors work in opposition in Scenario 4, in which both claim ratios and case outstanding strength \nare increasing. Even though expected claims are too low for Scenario 4, there is more than an", "type": "Document"}}
