Estimated IBNR is equal to the difference between projected ultimate claims \nand reported claims. For Auto Collision Insurer, the estimated IBNR is negative for all accident \nhalf-years except the latest period, 2008-1. Negative IBNR is often a result of either salvage and \nsubrogation recoveries, which are included with the claim development data, or a conservative \nphilosophy towards setting case outstanding. In this particular example, the negative IBNR is a \nresult of the downward (i.e., favorable) development of claim counts and not salvage or \nsubrogation recoveries. The total unpaid claim estimate is equal to the sum of case outstanding \nand estimated IBNR and is shown in Column (6) of Exhibit I, Sheet 8.  \n \n \n199", "type": "Document"}}
