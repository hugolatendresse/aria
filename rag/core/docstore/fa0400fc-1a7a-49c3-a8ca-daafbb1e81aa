For example, the incremental paid severity for accident year 2007 at 12 months is \n$10,086; after adjustment for trend to the 2008 cost level, the severity is $10,590 ($10,086 x \n1.051). The incremental paid severity for accident year 2003 at 72 months is $46,648; after \nadjustment for trend to the accident year 2008 cost level, the severity is $59,536 ($46,648 x \n1.055). \n \nWe calculate various averages of the trended severities at the bottom of Exhibit V, Sheet 8. As \nnoted, we observe an increasing pattern in the paid severities by age from 12 months through 96 \nmonths. At the bottom of Exhibit V, Sheet 8, we select incremental paid severities at the 2008 \ncost level for maturity ages 12 months through 60 months. Beyond this point, the data become \nsparse and unreliable for trending purposes. We rely on the simple average of the latest three \nyears for our selections. \n \nWhere we begin to see variability in the trended severities, we consider combining the experience \nof several maturity ages. Such variability may be the result of one or more large claims that were \nclosed at older ages. Variability is also often related to a smaller number of claims in the data set \nat the oldest maturity ages. By combining the experience of multiple years we seek to limit the \ninfluence of random large claims or other factors that can easily distort patterns in the severities. \n \nIn Exhibit V, Sheet 9, we review the combined experience of maturity ages 60 and older and 72 \nand older. We first present the triangle of incremental closed claim counts for maturities 60 \nthrough 96 months. We then summarize the incremental paid claims for these same maturities. \nSince the paid claims represent different cost levels, the next step is an adjustment based on the", "type": "Document"}}
