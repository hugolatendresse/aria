Analogously, the ultimate cost of \nclosed claims (C) as of a certain evaluation point represents the final cost of claims that \nare closed as of the valuation date including any subsequent payments. (Many times this \nmay simply be equal to the paid on closed if the line of business does not have \nsubsequent payments.) \n \nConger and Nolibos present a simplification where estimates of R and C are not required. \nFirst, they use the estimate of ultimate claims for the accident year as a proxy for the \nultimate costs of claims reported in the calendar year. The calendar year amount can be \nexpressed exactly as the sum of the corresponding accident year ultimate claims and the \npure IBNR at the beginning of the year less the pure IBNR at the end of the year. The \nactuary can evaluate the error in this approximation based on review of changes in \nexposures between accident years and the characteristics of the coverage being analyzed \nand make adjustments based on judgment as necessary.
