For the increasing claim ratio scenarios, \nwe assume the following claim ratios by accident year: \n \nTable 6 \u2013 Key Assumptions  \nIncreasing Claim Ratio Scenarios  \nAccident Year Ultimate Claim Ratio \n1999-2003 70% \n2004 80% \n2005 85% \n2006 90% \n2007 95% \n2008 100% \n \nWe use the earned premium and ultimate claim ratios as well as the given reporting and payment \npatterns to create reported and paid claim development triangles for each of the four scenarios \npreviously described. Claim development triangles are presented in Exhibit III, Sheets 2 through \n9.  \n \nTo simplify the presentation of the various scenarios, we always select reported and paid age-to-\nage factors based on a five-year volume-weighted average. When selecting age-to-age factors, an \nactuary would typically review several different types of averages as well as various claims \ndiagnostics. Actuaries incorporate significant judgment when selecting age-to-age factors to \nrespond to changes in the environment, both internal and external. By not responding in our \nexamples to the changes in the environment with judgmental adjustments, we further demonstrate \nhow the development technique reacts to a changing situation. \n \n \nScenario 1 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Steady-State  \n \nNot surprisingly, the projected ultimate claims are the same for both the reported and paid claim \ndevelopment methods in the steady-state environment. Both methods generate estimated IBNR \nthat is equal to the actual IBNR. We present calculations for the steady-state environment in the \ntop section of Exhibit III, Sheet 10.  \n \n \nScenario 2 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Increasing Claim Ratios  \n \nIn the bottom section of Exhibit III, Sheet 10, we present the calculations for the second scenario,", "type": "Document"}}
