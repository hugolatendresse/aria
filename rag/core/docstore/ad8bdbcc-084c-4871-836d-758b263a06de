As in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique, the Cape Cod \nmethod splits ultimate claims into two components: actual reported (or paid) and expected \nunreported (or unpaid). As an accident year (or other time interval) matures, the actual reported \nclaims replace the expected unreported claims and the initial expected claims assumption \nbecomes gradually less important. The primary difference between the two methods is the \nderivation of the expected claim ratio. In the Cape Cod technique, the expected claim ratio is \nobtained from the reported claims experience instead of an independent and often judgmental \nselection as in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. \n \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nThe key assumption of the Cape Cod method is that unreported claims will develop based on \nexpected claims, which are derived using reported (or paid) claims and earned premium. Both the \nCape Cod and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods differ from the development method where the \nprimary assumption is that unreported claims will develop based on reported claims to date (not \nexpected claims). \n \n \nCommon Uses of the Cape Cod Technique \n \nReinsurers are among the most frequent users of the Cape Cod technique. Actuaries generally use \nthe Cape Cod method in a reported claims application, but they can also use it with paid claims. \nThe technique is appropriate for all lines of insurance including short-tail lines and long-tail lines. \nSimilar to the development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, actuaries using the Cape Cod \nmethod can organize data in a variety of different time intervals: \n \n\uf0be Accident year \n\uf0be Policy year \n\uf0be Underwriting year \n\uf0be Report year \n\uf0be Fiscal year \n \nActuaries can also apply this technique with monthly, quarterly, or semiannual data.  \n \n \nMechanics of the Cape Cod Technique", "type": "Document"}}
