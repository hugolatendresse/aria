This method is similar to calendar-accident year except \nthe losses are aggregated according to when the claim was reported, as opposed to when the claim \noccurred.  This method is typically used for commercial lines products using claims-made policies (e.g., \nmedical malpractice), which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.   \nThe individual chapters dedicated to exposure, premium, and loss go into considerably more detail about \naggregating different statistics (e.g., written and earned premium; paid and reported losses) under each of \nthese aggregation methods. \nOverall\tversus\tClassification\tAnalysis\t\nIf the purpose of the ratemaking analysis is to review the adequacy of the overall rate level, the data can \nbe highly summarized.  Generally speaking, the premium, losses, and exposures can be aggregated by \nyear (i.e., calendar year, accident year, policy year, report year) for the product and location (e.g., state) \nbeing analyzed.   \nOn the other hand, if a classification analysis is being performed, then the data must be at a more granular \nlevel.  For a traditional univariate classification analysis, the data can be aggregated by year (typically \naccident year or policy year) for each level of the rating variable being studied.  For example, if it is a \nterritorial analysis, then the premium, losses, and exposures should be aggregated by year for each \nterritory.  In the case of a multivariate analysis (i.e., a simultaneous analysis of multiple variables), it is \npreferable to organize data at the individual policy or risk level.  Alternatively, the data can be aggregated \nby year for each unique combination of rating variables being studied.  If numerous rating variables are \nbeing considered, the aggregation (and compression) may be minimal and not worth undertaking. \nLimited\tData\t\nAs mentioned earlier, actuaries are sometimes required to perform ratemaking analysis when the preferred", "type": "Document"}}
