We demonstrate the potential difficulty in obtaining one single estimate of the claims \nliability through numerous examples applied to the same line of business for the same experience \nperiod. Each of the methods presented results in a different value of the unpaid claim estimate. \nFurthermore, we recognize that, to the extent that we are dealing with the estimation of the mean \nof a stochastic process, the actual unpaid claims will almost always differ from the estimate. \n \nClearly, a range of estimates of the unpaid and a statement of our confidence that the actual \nunpaid claims (as proven at final development) will be within the stated range are valuable to \nmanagement, regulators, policyholders, investors, and even the general public. However, the \ninsurer\u2019s balance sheet requires the insurer to record a point estimate of the unpaid claims.6 \n \nActuarial Standard of Practice No. 43 (ASOP 43) adopted in June 2007 by the ASB defines the \nactuarial central estimate as an estimate that represents an expected value over the range of \nreasonably possible outcomes. It is beyond the scope of this book to address ranges of unpaid \nclaim estimates. We refer the reader to the wealth of material published by the CAS and various \nother international actuarial organizations on the subject of ranges for unpaid claim estimates. \n \n \nBackground Regarding the Examples \n \nDifferences in Coverages and Lines of Business Around the World \n \nThere are significant differences in the types of P&C insurance offered around the world. There \nare also differences in the names that are used for similar coverages throughout the world. For", "type": "Document"}}
