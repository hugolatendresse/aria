We calculate estimated IBNR \nand the total unpaid claim estimate in Exhibit II, Sheet 7. \n \nWe observe that the estimated IBNR and total unpaid claim estimate from this type of frequency-\nseverity projection are higher than the estimated unpaid claims generated from the reported claim \ndevelopment technique and lower than the estimate generated from the paid claim development \ntechnique. At XYZ Insurer, we know that there have been changes in case outstanding adequacy \nand claims settlement procedures. Without appropriate adjustment to our projection techniques, \neither in the types of data that are used or the methodological adjustments, we may exacerbate \nproblems in our projected results. For an example, return to the projected number of ultimate \nclaims in Exhibit II, Sheet 3. Projected ultimate claim counts based on closed counts are \nsignificantly greater than projected ultimate claim counts based on reported counts. This is \nconsistent with our conclusions regarding an increased rate of claims settlement. Thus, it may be \nmore appropriate to rely on the reported claim count projection which is not affected by changes \nin claims closure patterns. This change alone reduces the estimated IBNR by more than $30 \nmillion. \n \n \n200", "type": "Document"}}
