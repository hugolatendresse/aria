DCC expenses include costs \nincurred in defending claims, including expert witness fees and other legal fees.  A&O include all other \nexpenses.  Prior to the switch, companies with in-house attorneys sometimes coded legal expenses as \nULAE, while companies using outside legal counsel coded these expenses as ALAE.  This historic \ndifference made comparing operations metrics across companies difficult.  The new standardization of the \ndefinitions makes these comparisons more meaningful.  Despite the change in U.S. financial reporting \ndefinitions, this text will refer to the subdivisions of ALAE and ULAE, which are more commonly used \nin ratemaking. \nIn general, ALAE or DCC vary by the dollar amount of each claim, while ULAE or A&O vary by the \nnumber of claims reported.  For ratemaking purposes, ALAE are often included with losses.  This \nincludes both the losses used for projection as well as the losses used in detecting patterns of loss \ndevelopment and trend.  Some pricing actuaries, most notably in commercial lines, may elect to study \ndevelopment and trend patterns separately for loss and ALAE.  This is done if ALAE are significantly \nhigh for the given line of business or in order to detect any changes in ALAE patterns.  It is also important \nfor the actuary to understand whether ALAE are subject to the policy limits or not.  This does not \nnecessarily affect the treatment of ALAE in a ratemaking context, but it emphasizes the need to", "type": "Document"}}
