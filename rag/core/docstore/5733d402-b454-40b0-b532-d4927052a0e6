The \ntrue total value of unpaid claims at December 31, 2008 is equal to the sum of the actual IBNR and \nthe case outstanding, or $1,230,997. The difference between the actual unpaid claims and the \nestimate of unpaid claims resulting from the reported claim development technique is significant. \nThe total unpaid claim estimate based on the reported claim development technique is $1,478,573 \n(projected ultimate claims in Column (8) minus paid claims in Column (4)) which is 20% greater \nthan the actual unpaid claims. The difference between the actual unpaid claims and the estimated \nunpaid claims generated by the reported claim development method is $247,596. From a calendar \nyear financial reporting perspective, this adds 16 points to the 2008 calendar year claim ratio \n($247,596 divided by the 2008 earned premium of $1,551,328). (This assumes that the insurer \nreports all of the difference in calendar year 2008.) \n \nBecause only the case outstanding are affected in Scenario 3, there are no differences between the \npaid claim development triangles of Scenario 3 and the steady-state environment. Since there are \nno differences in the paid claim triangles, the age-to-age factors, claim development factors to \nultimate, and projected ultimate claims all remain the same as the steady-state scenario. The \nestimated IBNR, which is equal to projected ultimate claims less reported claims at December 31, \n2008, is lower for this scenario than the steady-state scenario, however, since the latest valuation \nof reported claims is higher now due to the case outstanding strengthening.", "type": "Document"}}
