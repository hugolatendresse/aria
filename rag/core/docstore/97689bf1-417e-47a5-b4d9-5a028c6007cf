Management at XYZ Insurer believes very strongly in \nthe saying \u201ca good claim is a closed claim\u201d and has instituted policies and procedures to expedite \nthe claim settlement process.  \n \nIn addition to the changing environment within the insurer\u2019s operations, we know that there were \nsignificant changes to the automobile insurance product in this geographic region. Major tort \nreforms were implemented in 2006 resulting in caps on awards as well as pricing restrictions and \nmandated rate level changes for all insurers operating in the region. As a result of these reforms, \nmanagement decided to reduce its presence in this market. \n \nHaving met with management, it is now time to begin our diagnostic review of the data. One goal \nof such a review is to determine if we can observe the effect of the changes implemented by \nmanagement in the claims data provided by the insurer. We expect that our review will likely lead \nto further questions and result in more discussions with members of the management team. We \nalso hope that based on our diagnostic review, we will be able to determine what types of data \nand which techniques will be most appropriate to estimate unpaid claims for XYZ Insurer under \nits current circumstances. \n \n \nPremium History \n \nIn Table 1 below, we summarize earned premium as well as XYZ Insurer\u2019s historical rate \nchanges for this line of business. XYZ Insurer provided the earned premium and rate level \nchanges by year. We calculate the cumulative average rate level and annual change in exposures \nfrom year to year.28 \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Summary of Earned Premium and Rate Changes \n \nCalendar  \nYear \nEarned  \nPremiums  \n($000) \n \nRate  \nChanges \nCumulative \nAverage \nRate Level \nAnnual \nExposure \nChange \n2002 61,183  0.0%  \n2003 69,175 +5.0% 5.0% 7.7%", "type": "Document"}}
