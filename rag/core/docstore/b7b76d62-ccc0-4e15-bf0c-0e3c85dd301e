In practice, actuarial judgment plays a vital role in the selection of claim \ndevelopment factors.  \n \nIn Exhibit III, Sheet 4, we begin the adjustment process for changes in claims settlement rates. \nWe select disposal rates based on the last diagonal of closed claim counts divided by the \nprojected ultimate reported claim counts. (We developed the projected ultimate reported claim \ncounts in Chapter 11.) We follow the same approach that is described for Berq-Sher Auto BI \nInsurer. Exhibits III, Sheets 5 and 6, which provide for the derivation of adjusted paid claims, \nfollow the same format as the previous example.  \n \nWe analyze the adjusted paid claim development triangle in Exhibit III, Sheet 7. We select claim \ndevelopment factors based on the five-year volume-weighted average and compare these selected \nfactors to those selected in Chapter 7 based on the unadjusted paid claim triangle. For most \nmaturity ages, the selected development factors based on the adjusted paid claims are less than \nthose based on the unadjusted claims. This is consistent with our expectations since we believe \nthat the rate of settlement has increased, and thus, an unadjusted paid claim development method \nwould likely result in an overstated unpaid claim estimate. \n \nOur last projection for XYZ Insurer adjusts the data for changes in both case outstanding \nadequacy and the rate of claims settlement. Since we know that there have been changes in the \nrate of claims settlement for XYZ Insurer, we question the first projection, which is a case \noutstanding only adjustment. In our final projection, we use both an adjusted average paid claim \ntriangle and the adjusted average case outstanding triangle. There is one new adjusted triangle we", "type": "Document"}}
