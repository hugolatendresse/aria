If the line of \nbusiness has multiple coverages, this information is recorded by coverage (represented either as a \nseparate record or via a coverage indicator field).  For example, personal auto insurance databases \ntrack premium separately for bodily injury, property damage, comprehensive, collision, etc.  \nEarned and in-force premium can be calculated from the information on the record.  \n\uf0b7 Exposure:  This is typically the written exposure associated with each record.  If the line of \nbusiness has multiple coverages, this information is recorded by coverage. \n\uf0b7 Characteristics:  Characteristics include rating variables, underwriting variables, and any other \navailable information regarding the risk represented by the record.  Some characteristics describe \nthe policy as a whole (e.g., the year the policy originated with the company) and as such are the \nsame for every record associated with a particular policy and period of exposure.  Other \ncharacteristics describe individual risks (e.g., make/model of automobile) and consequently vary \nbetween different records on the same policy.   \n \nAs separate records are generated for midterm adjustments, the characteristics corresponding to each \nrecord are those that were in effect during the relevant period of exposure (e.g., if records are split to \nreflect a deductible change, the first record shows the initial deductible and the subsequent record(s) \nshows the new deductible).   \nFrequently, risk characteristic information is captured in multiple databases across the company and, as \nsuch, may be difficult to obtain and merge.  For some rating characteristics, it is advantageous to capture \na stable element from which the rating characteristic can be derived.  For example, age of driver is a \ntypical rating variable for personal automobile insurance; however, it is better to capture the date of birth", "type": "Document"}}
