Similar to the premium and loss \ntrend procedures discussed in earlier chapters, the actuary examines the historical change in average \nexpenses to select an expense trend.  Given the volatility of internal data, many companies use \ngovernment indices (e.g., Consumer Price Index, Employment Cost Index, etc.) and knowledge of \nanticipated changes in internal company practices to estimate an appropriate trend.  One such procedure is \nshown in Appendix B.  \nThe selected fixed expense ratio will be trended from the average date that expenses were incurred in the \nhistorical expense period to the average date that expenses will be incurred in the period that the rates are \nassumed to be in effect.  Thus, the trend period is different for expenses that are incurred at the beginning \nof the policy and expenses that are incurred throughout the policy.   \nExpenses that are incurred when the policies are written should be trended from the average date that the \npolicies were written in the historical period to the average written date in the projection period.  The \nfollowing figure shows the resulting trend period assuming annual policies are sold, a steady book of \nbusiness is maintained, and projected rates will be in effect for one year:  \n \nIn contrast, expenses that are incurred evenly throughout the policy period should be trended from the \naverage date the policies were earned in the historical period to the average earned date in the projection \nperiod.
