Since the steady-state \nenvironment also has a 70% ultimate claim ratio, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique generates \nan accurate estimate of IBNR. We see in Chapters 7 and 8, that the development and expected \nclaims techniques also generate accurate IBNR values in a steady-state environment. Detailed \ncalculations are presented for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method in the top section of Exhibit III, \nSheet 1. \n \n \n                                                 \n57 We present the following examples to demonstrate the effect of not changing assumptions on the \nresulting projections of ultimate claims and the estimate of unpaid claims. We recognize that the examples \nare not necessarily representative of real-life applications of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method since we \nassume that there are no adjustments in expected claims in anticipation of the events that caused higher \nclaim ratios or changes in business mix. Most insurers have a feel for whether a market is getting softer or \nharder, so they would have a sense as to the direction to adjust the expected claims, if not the absolute \namount of adjustment. In addition, actuaries typically use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique where \ndevelopment data is sparse and erratic, which is exactly where the development approaches are very weak. \nHence, we note that the PP Auto examples are biased against a Bornhuetter-Ferguson approach. \n157", "type": "Document"}}
