The age-to-ultimate factor is then based on cumulative addition (not multiplication) \nbeginning with the selected factor for the oldest age.  \n \nWe present the projection of ultimate ALAE using the additive approach in Exhibit I, Sheet 10. \nThe only difference between this projection and the projection in Exhibit I, Sheet 8, which is \nbased on the standard (i.e., multiplicative) approach, is that we add the paid ALAE ratio from the \nlatest diagonal of the triangle to the cumulative development factor instead of multiplying by the \ncumulative development factor. In Exhibit I, Sheet 9, we do not modify the ALAE ratio for the \nlatest years, instead we allow the initial projected ratio values for 2007 and 2008 to be used to \nproject ultimate ALAE. \n \nThe results of the four projections are summarized in Exhibit I, Sheet 11. In this exhibit, we also \npresent the estimated unpaid ALAE, which is equal to projected ultimate ALAE less paid ALAE. \nThe estimated unpaid ALAE in this exhibit represent total unpaid ALAE, including both case \noutstanding for ALAE and ALAE IBNR. We observe that without a tail factor, the projected \nALAE based on the standard development technique applied to the ratio of paid ALAE-to-paid \nclaims only appears low. Even if we change the tail factor to 1.005, this method still does not \nappear sufficient. The challenge is in selecting the ultimate ALAE ratio for the most recent two \naccident years. With a selected ratio of 0.0077, the estimate of unpaid ALAE is negative for \naccident year 2007. This intuitively does not seem correct based on our knowledge of the \nproperty damage line of insurance and the operations of XYZ Insurer. In selecting which method \nis appropriate for each accident year, the actuary will need to conduct similar evaluation analyses \nas described in Chapter 15 for claims. \n \n \nChoosing a Technique for Estimating Unpaid ALAE", "type": "Document"}}
