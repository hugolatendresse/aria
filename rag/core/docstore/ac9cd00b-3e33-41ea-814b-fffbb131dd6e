This is a \nmeasure of how the company\u2019s actual loss experience subject to the experience rating plan limitations \nwas relative to the expected loss experience represented in the current manual rates. \nThe expected experience ratio (EER) is essentially the complement of an expected deviation of the \ncompany\u2019s loss costs in the experience rating plan from the loss costs underlying the manual rate.  In this \nexample, the deviation is caused by application of the MSL in the experience rating plan.   \nThe experience rating credit/debit is calculated as a credibility weighting of the AER and the EER \naccording to the formula provided earlier:", "type": "Document"}}
