However, as demonstrated by the figures, expenses incurred throughout the policy are trended six \nmonths longer than expenses incurred at inception.  Actuaries may make the simplifying assumption that \nall expenses are either incurred at the inception of the policy or are incurred evenly throughout the policy \nperiod.  The materiality of this simplification depends on the magnitude of the expense trend and the \npercentage of premium that fixed expenses represent.   \nThe explanations and graphics shown above are theoretically correct depictions of the expense trend \nlength for each calendar year in the expense experience period.  In practice, however, many actuaries \nchoose to trend historical fixed expenses from a single \u201ctrend from\u201d date.  For example, if the actuary \nbelieves a three-year average expense ratio best represents the historical expense period, the \u201ctrend from\u201d \ndate for the average ratio would be the midpoint of the three-year period.  This gives approximately the \nsame value as trending each year\u2019s expense ratio separately and averaging the results.   If the selected \ntrend is based on the latest year only, the \u201ctrend from\u201d date would be the midpoint of the latest year.  \nMathematically this is the same as trending each year\u2019s expense ratio separately and choosing only the \nlatest year\u2019s trended ratio. \nAfter expenses are trended, the expense ratio or average dollar amount of expense is often called the \nprojected (or trended) fixed expense provision. \nREINSURANCE\tCOSTS\t\nAs mentioned in Chapter 6, some ratemaking analysis is now performed on a net basis (i.e., with \nconsideration of reinsurance).  This practice is becoming more common as reinsurance programs have \nbecome more extensive and reinsurance costs have increased substantially.", "type": "Document"}}
