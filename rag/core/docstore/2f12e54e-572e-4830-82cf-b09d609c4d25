These limitations \nmay pertain to either the overall average rate change for the jurisdiction or to the change in premium for \nany individual customer or group of customers, or both.  For example, a jurisdiction may prohibit a rate \nchange that generates an overall premium increase greater than 25% and/or a rate change that results in a \nsignificant number of existing customers getting an increase greater than 30%.  In fact, the limitation \ncould apply to any insureds seeing an increase larger than 30%.  To the extent that the indicated rates \nexceed either of these thresholds, the proposed rate change will not comply with regulation and will not \nbe approved by the regulator.  \nWhile some jurisdictions may not specifically limit the amount of the rate change, they may have \ndifferent regulatory requirements depending on the magnitude of the requested change.  For example, the \nregulatory authority may require a company to provide written notice to all insureds or hold a public \nhearing in the event a proposed rate change exceeds some specified threshold.  In such cases, a company \nmay decide to implement a rate change that is less than the threshold to avoid the extra requirements.  \nSome regulations prohibit the use of particular characteristics for rating, even though the characteristics \nmay be demonstrated to be statistically strong predictors of risk.  The use of insurance credit score for \nunderwriting or rating personal lines insurance (e.g., personal automobile or homeowners) is a good \nexample.  It is widely accepted that an individual\u2019s insurance credit score is a strong predictor of risk in \npersonal lines.  Where allowed, many companies charge higher premium for individuals with poor credit", "type": "Document"}}
