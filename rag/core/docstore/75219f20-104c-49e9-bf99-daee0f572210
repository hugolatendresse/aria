Given the current compensation rate of \n66.7%, the maximum benefit of $1,000 will be applicable to the workers who earn more than 150% of the \nSAWW (i.e., $1,000  =  66.7%  x  150%  x $1,000).  The 11 employees who are subjected to the current \nmaximum benefit constitute $11,000 (= 11 x $1,000) in benefits. \nThe remaining 58 (= 27 + 19 + 12) employees fall between the minimum and maximum benefits.  This \nmeans their total benefits are 66.7% of their actual wages or $42,354 ( = ( 66.7% x 23,950 ) + ( 66.7% x \n23,048 ) + ( 66.7% x 16,500 ) ). \nUnder the current benefit structure, the sum total of benefits is $68,854 (= $15,500 + $11,000 + $42,354). \nOnce the statute changes and the maximum benefit is reduced from 100% to 83.3% of the SAWW, more \nworkers will be subjected to the new maximum benefit.  Specifically workers earning approximately \n125% or more of the SAWW will be subjected to the maximum (i.e., $833.75 = (66.7% x 125% x $1,000)  \n> $833).  These 23 (= 11 + 12) workers will receive $19,159 (= 23 x $833) in benefits. \nThe number of workers affected by the minimum benefit, 31, is not impacted by the change.  Their \nbenefits remain $15,500. \nBecause more workers are now impacted by the maximum, there are now only 46 (= 27 + 19) employees \nthat receive a benefit equal to 66.7% of their pre-injury wages or: \n $31,348 (= ( 66.7% x  23,950 ) + ( 66.7% x 23,048 ) ). \nThe new sum total of benefits is $66,007 (= 19,159 + 15,500 + 31,348).  The direct effect (or expected \nchange in benefits) from revising the maximum benefit is calculated by comparing the benefits before and \nafter the change in maximum benefit; this is estimated at -4.1% (= 66,007 / 68,854 \u2013 1.0). \n6.6 Benefit E xamp le\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nRatio to \nAverage \nWeekly \nWage\n# \nWorkers\nTotal \nWeekly \nWages\nCurrent \nBenefits\nProposed \nBenefits\n<50% 7 3,000 $          3,500 $        3,500 $          \n50-75% 24 16,252 $        12,000 $      12,000 $", "type": "Document"}}
