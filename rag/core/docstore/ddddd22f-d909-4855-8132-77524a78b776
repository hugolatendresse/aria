Some claims \nopen and close on the same day with a single payment. Such claims would have only one \ntransaction and would likely never show a case outstanding value. In our example, when the \npartial payment occurs on April 1, 2009, the insurer reduces the case outstanding estimate by \nexactly the same amount as the claim payment. However, this chain of events may not happen for \nall claims. As an insurer makes a specific payment, it may choose to reduce the case outstanding \nmore than the payment, less than the payment, not reduce it at all, or even increase it, depending \non the exact circumstances of the particular claim. \n \nThe payments on a specific claim are the amounts paid through a given date or over some \nspecified time period. Therefore, when referring to paid claims, it is important to clearly state \nwhether the claims are cumulative or incremental. Cumulative paid claims refer to the sum of all \nclaim payments through the valuation date. Incremental paid claims refer to the sum of all claim \npayments made during a specified time interval. \n \n22", "type": "Document"}}
