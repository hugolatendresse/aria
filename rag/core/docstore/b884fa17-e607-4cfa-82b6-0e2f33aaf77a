The direct effect of this change is that any \nclaimants with jewelry, watches, and furs losses in excess \nof $3,000 will now only receive $3,000 rather than at most \n$5,000.  The direct effect of this change can be easily \ncalculated if a distribution of historical jewelry, watches, \nand furs losses is available.  Table 6.4 shows the how the \nreported losses on six claims would be capped under the \ntwo different thresholds.  \nGiven the data provided, the expected direct effect is equivalent to -27.3%, which is the ratio of all such \nlosses capped at $3,000 to all such losses capped at $5,000, minus 1.0.  If the revision were to increase the \nlimit to $6,000 (rather than decrease it), the data provided does not have enough information since all \nlosses were capped at the current inside limit of $5,000.  In such cases, the ratemaking actuary may need \nto consult claims studies to obtain the gross losses.   \nIn addition to the direct effect of a coverage change described above, there may be an indirect effect, too.  \nConsider the example involving a decrease in coverage.  Insureds who previously relied on the coverage \nprovided under their homeowners policy may feel the reduced coverage is inadequate and consequently \n6.4 Limit Change\n(1) (2) (3)\nClaim \nnum ber\nLos s es  \nCapped \n@$5,000\nLos s es  \nCapped \n@$3,000\nEffect of \nChange\n11 , 1 0 0$       1,100 $       0.0%\n22 , 3 5 0$       2,350 $       0.0%\n33 , 7 0 0$       3,000 $       -18.9%\n44 , 1 0 0$       3,000 $       -26.8%\n55 , 0 0 0$       3,000 $       -40.0%\n65 , 0 0 0$       3,000 $       -40.0%\nTotal 21,250$     15,450 $     -27.3%\n(1) Given\n(2) = Min[(1), $3,000]\n(3) = (2) / (1) - 1.0", "type": "Document"}}
