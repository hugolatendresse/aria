Trend adjusts the average historical claim from the loss cost level that exists on July 1, 2010, to \nthe loss cost level expected on January 1, 2013; while trended to the new cost level, the adjusted claim is \nstill not fully developed.  Development adjusts the trended, undeveloped claim to the ultimate level, \nwhich is expected to be achieved by June 30, 2014.  \nIn conclusion, the goal is to project the expected settlement value of the average historical claim (which \noccurred on July 1, 2010) as if it were to occur on December 31, 2012, and be settled on June 30, 2014.  \nThis duration of 48 months represents the 30 months of trend to adjust the cost level to that anticipated \nduring the forecast period and the 18 months of development to project this trended value to its ultimate \nsettlement value.  \nLOSS\tADJUSTMENT\tEXPENSES\t\nLoss adjustment expenses (LAE) are all costs incurred by a company during the claim settlement \nprocess.  As such, they are more appropriately placed with a discussion of losses than with other \ninsurance company expenses.   \nClaim adjusters\u2019 fees, claim department overhead, and legal defense costs are examples of LAE.  \nTraditionally, LAE have been divided into two categories, allocated and unallocated loss adjustment \nexpenses.  Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) are those costs that can easily be related to \nindividual claims.  Legal fees to defend against a specific claim or costs incurred by a claim adjuster \nassigned to one claim are ALAE.  Unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) are those that are \nmore difficult to assign to particular claims, such as claim department salaries. \nIn 1998, the insurance industry introduced new LAE definitions in an attempt to improve financial \nreporting consistency between companies in the US.
