Thus, the next step of this method is to calculate \nthe expected unreported claims. In Column (7), we calculate expected unreported claims by \naccident year. Expected unreported claims are equal to expected claims in Column (2) multiplied \nby the percentage unreported in Column (5) for each year. Similarly, expected unpaid claims in \nColumn (8) are equal to expected claims from Column (2) multiplied by the percentage unpaid in \nColumn (6).  \n \nReturning to our original formulae for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, \n \nUltimate Claims = Actual Reported Claims + Expected Unreported Claims \n  \nUltimate Claims = Actual Paid Claims + Expected Unpaid Claims \n \nWe can now calculate the projected ultimate claims.
