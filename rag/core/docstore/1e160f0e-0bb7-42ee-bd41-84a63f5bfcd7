Because higher limits offer additional coverage for claims that are less frequent and very \nsevere, the experience for these limits can be volatile.  The greater variability adds uncertainty that makes \nthese limits challenging to price and risky for insurers; consequently, insurers may alter the profit \nprovision in the rates to reflect the higher cost of capital needed to support the additional risk.
