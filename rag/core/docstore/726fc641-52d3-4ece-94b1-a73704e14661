The lines \nrepresenting the rate changes are still diagonal.  The following picture shows the policy year adjustment \nassuming the same rate changes and an annual policy term: \n \nAs Policy Year 2011 has one rate level applied to the whole year, it is more helpful to show an example \nfor Policy Year 2012, which has two rate level groups.  The area of each parallelogram is base x height.  \nFor example, area 3 in Policy Year 2012 has a base of 3 months (or 0.25 of a year) and the height is 12 \nmonths (or 1.00 year).  The relevant areas (Step 2) for Policy Year 2012 are as follows: \n\uf0b7 Area 3 in PY 2012: 0.25 = 0.25 x 1.00 \n\uf0b7 Area 4 in PY 2012:    0.75 = 0.75 x 1.00 \n \nThe cumulative rate level indices (Step 3) are the same as those used in the calendar year example. \nThe average rate level index (Step 4) for Policy Year 2012 is: \n.. x .  . x .  . 750143512501550114641 \uf02b\uf03d\n \nThe following is the on-level factor (Step 5) to adjust Policy Year 2012 earned premium to current rate \nlevel: \n..\n.  . 14641\n1435199750 \uf03d  \nRate\tChanges\tMandated\tby\tLaw\t\nThe previous example considers standard rate changes whereby the effective date of the rate change \napplies to policies effective on or after that date.  In some cases, rate changes are in response to law \nchanges that may mandate the rate change be applied to all policies on or after a specific date, even those \nthat are currently in-force.
