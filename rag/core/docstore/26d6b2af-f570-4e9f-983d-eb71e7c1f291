Compare this to \nthe occurrence policy in which the unexpected trend resulted in an Accident Year 2011 loss cost that is \n6.1% (=$1,230.66 / 1,160.39 -1.0) higher than the original estimate.  Since occurrence policies cover \nclaims that may be reported much further in the future and such claims are more significantly affected by \ntrend, an error made in the trend selection has more of an impact than for claims-made policies. \nPrinciple\t3\t\nPrinciple 3 states, \u201cIf there is a sudden, unexpected shift in the reporting pattern, the cost of a mature \nclaims-made policy will be affected relatively little, if at all, relative to the occurrence policy.\u201d  Instead of \n20% of the claims being reported each year, assume that 5% of the claims are reported one year later than \nexpected, but all claims are reported within five years.  As an example, in 2010, $50 of the loss cost shifts \nfrom lag 0 to lag 1, $50 of the loss costs from lag 1 shift to lag 2, and so on.  Since an equal amount of \nloss costs are shifting in and out of lag periods 1, 2, and 3, the only impact is on the first and last lag \nperiods.   \n \n16.4 U nexp ected  Trend\n01 234\nClaims-\nmade Los s  \nCosts\nOccurrence \nLos s  Cos ts\n2010 200.00$     200.00 $     200.00 $      200.00 $     200.00 $     1,000.00$     2010 1,150.15$       \n2011 214.00$     214.00 $     214.00 $      214.00 $     214.00 $     1,070.00$     2011 1,230.66$       \n2012 228.98$     228.98 $     228.98 $      228.98 $     228.98 $     1,144.90$     2012 1,316.81$       \n2013 245.01$     245.01 $     245.01 $      245.01 $     245.01 $     1,225.05$     2013 1,408.99$       \n2014 262.16$     262.16 $     262.16 $      262.16 $     262.16 $     1,310.80$     2014 1,507.62$", "type": "Document"}}
