The insurance company may initiate \nchanges in coverage; for example, a company may expand or contract coverage with respect to the types \nof losses covered or may opt to increase or decrease the amount of coverage offered.  Benefit levels can \nalso be impacted by a law change or court ruling.  Examples of this include caps on punitive damages for \nauto liability coverage and changes in the workers compensation statutory benefit levels.   \nIn consideration of the fundamental insurance equation, future projected losses need to reflect the \ncoverage/benefit levels expected during the time that rates will be in effect.  Benefit changes can have \nboth direct and indirect effects on losses.  Direct effects, as the name implies, are a direct and obvious \nconsequence of the benefit change.  Indirect effects, on the other hand, arise from changes in claimant \nbehavior that are a consequence of the benefit change; these are usually much more difficult to quantify \nthan direct effects.  The pricing actuary needs to understand the benefit change and its anticipated direct \neffect and, if possible, the indirect effect in order to adjust losses accordingly.  Ideally, the historical loss \ndata will be available by individual claim so that each claim can be restated to be consistent with the new \nbenefit levels.  This restatement can be incredibly cumbersome and therefore impractical.  Other \nalternatives include studying the average restatement effect of groups of claims (e.g., by type of injury) or \nsimulating loss data under the new benefit conditions. \nConsider the following examples to better understand the quantification of benefit changes. \nInsurance companies determine the amount of coverage \nprovided by a policy, either as a specified amount or a \nrange of options for the policyholder.
