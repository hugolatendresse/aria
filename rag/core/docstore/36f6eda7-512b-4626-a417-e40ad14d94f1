This is due to the expected \nclaim ratio assumption that is unchanged from the U.S. Auto Steady-State.  \n \nSince the commercial automobile segment is growing at a greater rate than the private passenger \nauto segment, and since commercial automobile has a higher ultimate claim ratio, the actuary \nneeds to modify the expected claim ratio assumption. Without such modification, the estimated \nIBNR from both the expected claims and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods proves inadequate. \nThe reporting and payment patterns also require change. With an increasing proportion of \ncommercial automobile, the reporting and payment patterns lengthen, and thus result in the \nrequirement for a higher IBNR value. \n \n \nBenktander Technique \n \nAn often-cited advantage of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique versus the development \ntechnique is stability in the presence of sparse data. However, since the estimate of unpaid claims \nfor the most recent accident years using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique is heavily dependant \non the actuary\u2019s judgment when determining the expected claims, actual claims emergence for \nthese years may be ignored to some extent.  \n \nThe Benktander method, introduced in 1976, is a credibility-weighted average of the Bornhuetter-\nFerguson technique and the development technique. The advantage cited by the authors is that \nthis method will prove more responsive than the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique and more stable \nthan the development technique. (For further information on the development of the technique \nand underlying proofs of the methodology, see Thomas Mack\u2019s 2000 ASTIN Bulletin paper \n\u201cCredible Claims Reserves: The Benktander Method.\u201d)  \n \nThe Benktander method is often considered an iterative Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. The only \ndifference in the two methods is the derivation of the expected claims. As we discuss in Chapter 8", "type": "Document"}}
