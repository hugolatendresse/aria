This can include hurricanes, tornadoes, \nhail storms, earthquakes, wildfires, winter storms, explosions, oil spills and certain terrorist attacks\u2014\nthough this list is hardly exhaustive.   \nIn the U.S., the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO) currently \ndefines catastrophes as events that cause $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and that \naffect a significant number of policyholders and insurers.  Insurance companies may have alternative \ndefinitions for their own internal procedures.   \nLike shock losses, catastrophe losses are typically removed from ratemaking data to avoid distorting \neffects in any ratemaking analysis.  In the process of projecting future losses, the actual catastrophe losses \nare replaced with an average expected catastrophe loss amount.  The method used to calculate such a \nprovision varies by type of insurance, or more specifically by the type of catastrophic loss to which the \nline of business is exposed.  The type of catastrophic loss is often broken down into non-modeled \ncatastrophe losses and modeled catastrophe losses. \nNon-modeled catastrophe analysis is generally undertaken on events that happen with some regularity \nover a period of decades.  For example, the most common catastrophic loss related to private passenger \nautomobile comprehensive coverage (which covers most forms of physical damage to the insured\u2019s car \nother than collision) is hail storms.  These storms happen with some mid-term regularity though loss \nprojections based on a short experience period (e.g., three to five years) may lead to ratemaking \ninstability.  Without a catastrophe procedure, indicated rates will increase immediately after a bad storm \nyear and decrease in years when no or few storms occur.   \nSimilar to the excess loss procedure, the actuary can calculate the ratio of hail storm losses to non-storm", "type": "Document"}}
