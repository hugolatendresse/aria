However, the equivalency of the \ntwo formulae depends on consistent data and assumptions being used for both approaches.  To the extent \nthat does not happen, it is possible that the approaches will produce different results.  For example, if the \npremium at current rate level is estimated using the parallelogram method rather than the more accurate \nextension of exposures method, any inaccuracy introduced by the approximation may result in \ninconsistency between the loss ratio and pure premium methods. \nINDICATION\tEXAMPLES\t\nThis and the preceding chapters have provided different techniques that can be used to determine an \noverall rate level indication.  The exact techniques used by the actuary will vary depending on a variety of \nfactors, including unique characteristics of the product being priced, data limitations, historical \nprecedence, and regulatory constraints. \nAppendices A-D provide overall rate level indication examples for four different insurance products.  \nEach of these example indications is based on several years of subject experience.  Calculating the total \nloss ratio (or pure premium) can be done in different ways.  Many companies sum projected ultimate loss \nand LAE across all years and divide by projected earned premium at present rates (or projected", "type": "Document"}}
