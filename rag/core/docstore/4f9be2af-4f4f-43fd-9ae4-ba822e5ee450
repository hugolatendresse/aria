They provide valuable diagnostics that aid in understanding \nthe certainty and reasonableness of results.  They can be refined to incorporate interaction variables.  The \nlitmus test of practicality is when multivariate methods are transparent and results can be incorporated in \ninsurance company rating algorithms. \nGeneralized linear models have become the standard for classification ratemaking in most developed \ninsurance markets\u2014particularly because of the benefit of transparency.  Understanding the mathematical \nunderpinnings is an important responsibility of the ratemaking actuary who intends to use such a method.  \nLinear models are a good place to start as GLMs are essentially a generalized form of such a model.  As \nwith many techniques, visualizing the GLM results is an intuitive way to connect the theory with the \npractical use. \nGLMs do not stand alone as the only multivariate classification method.  Other methods such as CART, \nfactor analysis, and neural networks are often used to augment GLM analysis.  Finally, the adoption of \nGLMs and data mining techniques influenced classification ratemaking in other ways as well\u2014\nparticularly in the incorporation of external data to enhance analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
