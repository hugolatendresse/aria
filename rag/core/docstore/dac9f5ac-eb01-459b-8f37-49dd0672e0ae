The company can use this information to \nbetter estimate the profit expected if it copies the competitor\u2019s rates.  Since there will be differences in the \nway the companies operate as well as differences in the distribution of the portfolios, copying a \ncompetitor\u2019s rates exactly will not guarantee the same results for the company introducing the new \nproduct.  The company should use judgment to determine a range of outcomes with respect to how much \nbetter or worse it expects profit for the new product to be based on the assessment of the company\u2019s \nsituation compared to the competitor\u2019s situation. \nDepending on the situation, the company may simply use the competitor\u2019s manual as a starting point and \nmake adjustments based on known or suspected differences.  The following are a few examples of \npotential adjustments. \nFirst, the company may estimate its fixed expenses will be higher or lower than those of the target \ncompetitor.  In such a case, the company can simply increase or decrease the competitor\u2019s expense fee by \nthe appropriate percentage.  For example, assume the company estimates its fixed expenses will be 10% \nlower than the competitor\u2019s.  If the competitor has an expense fee of $25.00, then the company should \nimplement an expense fee of $22.50, which is equivalent to the target competitor\u2019s fee of $25 multiplied \nby a factor of 0.90 ( = 1.0 - 0.10 ).", "type": "Document"}}
