If we return to the questions raised in Chapter 6, we wonder whether or not the \nspeed-up in settlement has resulted in a shift in the type of claim now being closed at each \nmaturity age. The actuary must consider the effect of this phenomenon on the projection \nmethodology and the true unpaid claims requirement for XYZ Insurer.  \n \nWe perform a review of the tail severity in Exhibit VI, Sheet 5. We select a tail severity of \n$70,432 for ages 84 and 96. In Exhibit VI, Sheets 6 and 7, we present the development of \nprojected ultimate claims by accident year-maturity age cell. Exhibit VI, Sheet 8 displays the \ncalculation of estimated IBNR and the total unpaid claim estimate. \n \nWe compare the results of the three frequency-severity projections for XYZ Insurer with the \nresults of the Cape Cod method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, the expected claims method, \nand the development method in Exhibit VI, Sheet 9 (projected ultimate claims) and in Exhibit VI, \nSheet 10 (estimated IBNR). \n \n \nWhen the Frequency-Severity Techniques Work and When they Do Not \n \nFrequency-severity techniques can be valuable in many situations. Both paid and reported claim \ndevelopment methods can prove unstable and inaccurate for the more recent accident years. We \ncan address the weaknesses of these methods by separating the estimates of ultimate claims into \nthe components of frequency and severity. For many lines of insurance, the number of claims \nreported is stable, and thus the projection of ultimate claim counts based on a development \napproach generally produces reliable estimates. Similarly, we can often estimate the severity, \nparticularly for the more mature accident years, with greater certainty. By adjusting severities \nfrom older years by trend factors, the actuary may be able to readily develop estimates of", "type": "Document"}}
