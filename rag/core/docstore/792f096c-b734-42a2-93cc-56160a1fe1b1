Since reported claims are comprised of the sum of case outstanding and paid claims, a \nchange in the case outstanding triangle will result in changes to the reported claim triangle. These \nchanges result in changes in the age-to-age factors along the latest two diagonals and changes in \nthe cumulative reported claim development factors. \n \nBefore we review the detailed calculations, we can discuss conceptually what we expect to see \nhappen with the projections. The true ultimate claims have not changed from the steady-state \nenvironment. Ultimate claims for this scenario are equal to 70% of earned premium for each year \nin the experience period. We should have higher values of reported claims since we know that \ncase outstanding strength has increased. For example, where case outstanding are $380,075 for \naccident year 2008 in the steady-state environment, they are now $475,094. Given the same value \nof ultimate claims with higher values of reported claims at December 31, 2008, the IBNR should \ndecrease. The actual IBNR50 for the scenario of stable claim ratios and increases in case \noutstanding strength are $253,336 (for all years combined); these are lower than the actual IBNR \nof the steady-state, which are $438,638. \n \nWe now turn to the detailed calculations in the top section of Exhibit III, Sheet 11. When we \ncompare the projections of Scenario 3 with those of the steady-state environment, we observe \nseveral differences. First, for accident years 2005 through 2008, reported claims in Column (3) \nare greater than the reported claims of the steady-state. We also note that the reported claim \ndevelopment factors to ultimate (Column (6)) are higher for the latest three accident years in \nScenario 3 than in the steady-state scenario.
