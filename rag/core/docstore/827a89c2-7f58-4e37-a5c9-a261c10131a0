If a policy is amended during the policy term, then \nseparate records are created for the partial policy periods before and after the change.  Examples will be \nprovided later to better illustrate this requirement. \nThe following are fields typically present for each record on the policy database: \n\uf0b7 Policy identifier  \n\uf0b7 Risk identifier(s):  As mentioned earlier, products may only insure one risk per policy, and \npolicy identifier is sufficient.  For other products that insure multiple risks on a policy, unique \nrisk identifiers are required.  As in the example above, vehicle number and operator number may \nbe necessary for personal auto databases.   \n\uf0b7 Relevant dates:  Each individual record contains the original effective and termination dates for \nthe policy or coverage within a policy.  If separate records are maintained for individual risks \nand/or individual coverages on the policy, the start date of each risk/coverage is recorded.  For \nexample, if collision coverage for a new car is added to an existing auto policy, a record is added \nwith the relevant start date noted.  In addition, if separate records are maintained for midterm \namendments (e.g., a change in the deductible), the date of the amendment is recorded.   \n                                                      \n6Some workers compensation carriers record policy information at the individual employee level, but this is not \ncommon.", "type": "Document"}}
