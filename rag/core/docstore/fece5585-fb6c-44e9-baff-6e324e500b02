Automobile physical damage and property are \nexamples of coverages in which actuaries can observe this type of development experience. For \nsome insurers, salvage and subrogation recoveries lag the reporting and payment of claims, which \ncan result in report-to-report factors that are less than 1.00. For some insurers, a conservative \nphilosophy regarding case outstanding can also result in an observed downward development of \nreported claims as payments for claims may be less than the case outstanding set by claims \nadjusters. For those lines of business for which the actuary derives cumulative claim development \nfactors that are less than 1.00, we revisit the original premise of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \nmethod.  \n \nAt the beginning of this chapter, we refer to Brosius\u2019 description of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \nmethod as a credibility-weighting between the development method and the expected claims \nmethod. Credibility is concerned with the combination of the projections from these two methods. \nThe basic formula for calculating the credibility-weighted projection is: \n \n[(Z) x (development method)] + [(1 \u2013 Z) x (expected claims method)], \n \nwhere, \n0 \u2264 Z \u2264 1, \nZ is the credibility assigned to the development method, and \n(1 \u2013 Z) is the complement of credibility assigned to the expected claims method. \n \nAs noted earlier, the credibility is equal to the percentage of claims developed at a particular stage \nof maturity, which is a function of the cumulative claim development factor (Z = 1.000 / \ncumulative development factor). \n \nFrom a theoretical perspective, the credibility-weighting approach of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson", "type": "Document"}}
