Similarly, the adjusted pure premium approach attempts to standardize data for the uneven \nmix of business by multiplying exposures by the exposure-weighted average of all other rating variables\u2019 \nrelativities before calculating the one-way relativities.  Again, this is merely an approximation to a proper \nreflection of all exposure correlations. \nMINIMUM\tBIAS\tPROCEDURES\t\nAnother classification ratemaking approach that was popular during the latter half of the 20th century is \nthe family of minimum bias procedures.  Essentially these are iteratively standardized univariate \napproaches.  Each procedure involves the selection of a rating structure (e.g., additive, multiplicative or \ncombined) and the selection of a bias function (e.g., balance principle, least squares, \u03c72, and maximum \nlikelihood bias functions).  The bias function is a means of comparing the procedure\u2019s observed loss \nstatistics (e.g., loss costs) to indicated loss statistics and measuring the mismatch.  Both sides of this \nequation must be weighted by the exposures in each cell to adjust for an uneven mix of business.  The \nterm \u201cminimum bias\u201d refers to the commonly used balance principle that requires that the sum of the \nindicated weighted pure premiums equals the sum of the weighted observed loss costs for every level of \nevery rating variable.  This is referred to as \u201cminimizing the bias\u201d along the dimensions of the \nclassification system.   \nA simple example of the balance principle applied to a multiplicative personal auto rating structure is \noutlined below.  This example assumes only two rating variables:  gender and territory.  Gender has \nvalues male (with a rate relativity expressed as g1) and female (g2).  Territory has values urban (t1) and", "type": "Document"}}
