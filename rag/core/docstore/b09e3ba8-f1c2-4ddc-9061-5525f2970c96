Premium taxes and licensing fees are examples of items included in this category. \nUnderwriting\tProfit\t\t\nAs mentioned earlier, the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known at the time of the sale.  By \nwriting insurance policies, the company is assuming the risk that premium may not be sufficient to pay \nclaims and expenses.  The company must support this risk by maintaining capital, and this entitles it to a \nreasonable expected return (profit) on that capital.  The two main sources of profit for insurance \ncompanies are underwriting profit and investment income.  Underwriting profit, or operating income, is \nthe sum of the profits generated from the individual policies and is akin to the profit as defined in most \nother industries (i.e., income minus outgo).  Investment income is the income generated by investing \nfunds held by the insurance company. \nChapter 7 outlines the derivation of underwriting expense provisions and how to incorporate the \nunderwriting expenses and underwriting profit in ratemaking analysis.  The derivation of the underwriting \nprofit provision in consideration of investment income and a target return on equity is beyond the scope \nof this text. \nFUNDAMENTAL\tINSURANCE\tEQUATION\t\nEarlier in the chapter, the basic economic relationship for the price of any product was given as follows: \n Profit. Cost   Price \uf02b\uf03d   \nThis general economic formula can be tailored to the insurance industry using the basic insurance \nterminology outlined in the preceding section.  Premium is the \u201cprice\u201d of an insurance product.  The \n\u201ccost\u201d of an insurance product is the sum of the losses, claim-related expenses, and other expenses \nincurred in the acquisition and servicing of policies.  Underwriting profit is the difference between \nincome and outgo from underwriting policies, and this is analogous to the \u201cprofit\u201d earned in most other", "type": "Document"}}
