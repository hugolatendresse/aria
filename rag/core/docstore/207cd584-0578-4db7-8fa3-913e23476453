We reproduce this graph in Exhibit I, Sheet 10. He notes that estimating \nseverity trends for medical malpractice is complicated by the following factors: \n \n\uf0be The slow payment of claims substantially reduces the data available by accident year (less \nthan 3% of ultimate claims are paid during the first 24 months and less than 30% during the \nfirst 60 months) \n \n\uf0be Severity trends can be distorted by irregular settlements and variation in the rate of claims \nclosed without payment \n \nHe concludes: \u201cThe degree of judgment necessary in the estimation of the severity trend makes \nthis substantial effect on the loss reserve estimate particularly critical.\u201d While the CAS published \nThorne\u2019s review in 1978, his comments are equally applicable today. \n \n                                                 \n74 PCAS, 1978 \n287", "type": "Document"}}
