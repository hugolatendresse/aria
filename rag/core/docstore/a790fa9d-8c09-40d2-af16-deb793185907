For \nratemaking purposes in most lines of business, the general interest is the development of reported losses \nincluding allocated loss adjustment expenses. \nThe analysis should be undertaken on a body of homogeneous claims.  This may imply a line of business \nor something more granular (e.g., coverages or types of losses within that line of business).  Liability \nclaims and property claims are typically analyzed separately.  Experience by geography (e.g., state) may \nalso be analyzed separately where there is sufficient volume.  As will be discussed later in this section, the \nextraordinary losses should be removed and the losses should be adjusted for any material benefit \nchanges. \nClaims data or loss data for this method is usually organized in a triangle format as shown in Table 6.11.  \nEach row is a different accident year.  The columns represent each accident year\u2019s reported losses at \nsuccessive maturities, starting at 15 months and increasing in annual increments.  In this example, losses \nare assumed to be at ultimate levels at 75 months, so no more columns are required.  Note, for some lines \nof business, ultimate may not be attained for several more years.  Each diagonal represents a date as of \nwhich the evaluation of losses is made (the valuation date).  For example, the latest diagonal represents a \nvaluation date of March 31, 2008. \n \nThe boxed value is the reported losses for accidents occurring in 2004 at 27 months of maturity (i.e., the \nlosses paid and case reserves held as of March 31, 2006 for accidents occurring in 2004).
