Joseph O. Thorne, in his review of the Berquist-Sherman paper, notes: \n\u201cLack of recognition of the settlement patterns by size of loss can be an important source of error \n\u2026 it may be necessary to modify the technique to apply to size of loss categories adjusted for \n\u2018inflation\u2019.\u201d Thorne presents a detailed example in which the number of small claims (limited to \n$3,000) is steadily decreasing and the number of larger claims (limited to $20,000) is steadily \nincreasing. He shows that the percentage of closed claim counts decreases and yet the percentage \nof paid claims increases due to the shift to settling larger claims. Thus, he notes that the Berquist-\nSherman technique actually adjusts paid claims to be less comparable among accident years and \nincreases the error in the estimate of unpaid claims. He concludes: \u201cAlthough the example is \nhypothetical, it was selected recognizing the recent trend toward an increasing proportion of \nsevere, late closing claims in many lines of business and demonstrates the hazards of not \nrecognizing settlement patterns by size of loss.\u201d78 \n \n \n                                                 \n77 We note that actuaries must take care when extrapolating development patterns particularly for high \nmaturity ages where data is thin. For volatile age-to-age factors, extrapolation can lead to unreasonable \nestimates of age-to-age factors. \n \n78 PCAS, 1978. \n290", "type": "Document"}}
