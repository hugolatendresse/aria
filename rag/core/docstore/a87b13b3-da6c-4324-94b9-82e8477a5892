One such technique compares the expected outcome of the model with historical \nresults on a hold-out sample of data (i.e., data that was not used in the development of the model so that it \ncould be used to test the effectiveness of the model).  The extent to which the model results track closely \nto historical results for a large part of the portfolio is an indication of how well the model validates.  The \nfollowing example output is a validation of a frequency model.  For most of the sample, the bands of \nexpected frequencies from the GLM (ordered from lowest to highest) track very closely to the actual \nweighted frequency of each band in the hold-out sample of data.  The volatile results for the high \nexpected frequency bands are a result of low volume of data. \n  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7\n2008\n2009", "type": "Document"}}
