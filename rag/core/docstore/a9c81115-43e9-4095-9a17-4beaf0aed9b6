We rely extensively on the 2003 paper by Robert F. Conger, FCAS, FCIA, \nMAAA and Alejandra Nolibos, FCAS, MAAA \u201cEstimating ULAE Liabilities: Rediscovering and \nExpanding Kittel\u2019s Approach.\u201d 90  \n \nULAE (known as ILAE in Canada) refer to general overhead expenses associated with the \nclaims-handling process, and particularly the costs of investigating, handling, paying, and \nresolving claims. We can differentiate between ALAE and ULAE. As described in Chapter 16, \nALAE are those costs that can be assigned to a specific claim. Examples of ALAE include legal \nfees, the cost of expert witnesses, police reports, engineering reports, and independent adjusters if \nassigned to a particular claim. In contrast, ULAE are the costs that cannot be assigned to a unique \nclaim; ULAE are those costs associated with operating the claims department, including rent, \ntechnology, salaries, as well as management and administrative expenses. \n \nThere are two broad classifications of techniques for estimating unpaid ULAE: dollar-based and \ncount based. These techniques, which rely on fundamentally different assumptions, vary \nsignificantly in the amount of data and calculations required. In practice, the seemingly divergent \nassumptions of the various methods may not affect the resulting unpaid ULAE estimates quite as \nseverely as it might seem at first glance. Since the methods are used for an entire population of \nclaims, they need to be correct only for the \u201caverage\u201d claim being reported, handled, paid, or \nclosed during a time period \u2013 not for each individual claim. In other cases, the gulf can be bridged \nby stratifying the claims data and types of transactions and making assumptions about the relative", "type": "Document"}}
