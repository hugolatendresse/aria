If rate \nrelativities are also \nchanged, the amount of \ndislocation can vary \nsignificantly for \ndifferent insureds or \nclasses of insureds.  \nTypically, companies \nlook at the distribution \nof rate changes across \nthe entire book of \nbusiness, summarized \nby key segments, and \nby each level of rating \nvariables being \nspecifically adjusted.  \nChart 13.15 shows the \ndistribution of policies \nacross various rate change ranges. \nAssimilating\tthe\tInformation\t\nOnce the traditional actuarial indications and marketing considerations are known, the decision-maker \nneeds to weigh all information and select the rates that best meet the goals of the company.  Typically, \nthis is done judgmentally. \nFor example, assume the following about a particular class of business: \n\uf0b7 Current average premium   = $1,000  \n\uf0b7 Indicated average premium   = $1,200 (or 20% increase) \n\uf0b7 Competitor\u2019s average premium   = $1,000 \n\uf0b7 Close ratio, retention ratio, and growth are all significantly below target \n \nThe company may conclude that implementation of a 20% increase will cause significant loss of renewal \ncustomers and prohibit new business growth.  In this situation, the company should consider the \nramifications of implementing the change versus not implementing the change.  If the company decides \nthe full increase should not be implemented, it can consider other non-pricing solutions to improve \nprofitability (e.g., revise underwriting guidelines or marketing strategies).  Along the same lines, in \nmarkets where rates are promulgated by regulation or rate changes are difficult to obtain, companies often \nperform ratemaking analysis but rely on the information to improve profitability through these non-\npricing solutions.", "type": "Document"}}
