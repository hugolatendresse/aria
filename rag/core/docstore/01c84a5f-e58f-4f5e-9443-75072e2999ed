According to the NAIC\u2019s \u201cQuarterly and Annual \nStatement Instructions for the year 2007, Property/Casualty,\u201d the Appointed Actuary must provide \u201cRELEVANT \nCOMMENT\u201d paragraphs to address the specific topic of reinsurance. The Instructions state: \n \nRELEVANT COMMENT paragraphs should address retroactive reinsurance, financial reinsurance \nand reinsurance collectibility. Before commenting on reinsurance collectibility, the actuary should \nsolicit information from management on any actual collectibility problems, review ratings given to \nreinsurers by a recognized rating service, and examine Schedule F for the current year for \nindications of regulatory action or reinsurance recoverable on paid losses over 90 days past due. \nThe comment should also reflect any other information the actuary has received from management \nor that is publicly available about the capability or willingness of reinsurers to pay claims. The \nactuary\u2019s comments do not imply an opinion on the financial condition of any reinsurer. \n \nOSFI, the Canadian regulator for federally registered insurance companies, requires the Appointed Actuary\u2019s Report \n(i.e., the report on policy liabilities) to contain a description of the insurer\u2019s reinsurance arrangements during the \nexperience period used in the report. Specifically, the Appointed Actuary is required to report on: \n\uf0be Types of arrangements \n\uf0be Significant terms and conditions \n\uf0be Order of application of treaties  \n\uf0be Changes in the arrangements, including changes in retentions or limits \n \nAppointed Actuaries for Canadian insurers are also required to report on how any changes in reinsurance arrangements \nwere taken into account in the development of unpaid claims for the insurer. \n34", "type": "Document"}}
