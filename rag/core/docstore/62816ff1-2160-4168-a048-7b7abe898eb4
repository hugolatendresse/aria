This assumption is not appropriate \nfor all lines of business; for example, professional liability or employment practices \nliability are lines of business where a significant portion of the claims-related expenses \nwill be incurred with its settlement. \n \nIf it is appropriate, for a particular line of business, to assume that U3 = 0, then U1 + U2 = \n100%, and we can approximate B, the claims basis for each calendar year as  \n \nEst.
