Time and motion studies, as described by Joanne Spalla,102 could also \nbe used to develop an empirical basis for the parameters. \n \nFor a particular time period T, Conger and Nolibos define M, the total amount spent on ULAE \nduring a time period T, to be \n \nM = (U1 x R x W) + (U2 x P x W) + (U3 x C x W), where \n \n\uf0b7 R \u2013 ultimate cost of claims reported during T \n\uf0b7 P \u2013 claims paid during T \n\uf0b7 C \u2013 the ultimate cost of claims closed during T \n\uf0b7 W \u2013 ratio of ultimate ULAE to ultimate claims (L) \n \nConceptually, the time period T could represent activity occurring between t1 and t2 related to a \nparticular accident year or for all accident years, where t1 and t2 are selected points in time. \n \nConger and Nolibos algebraically derive the ratio W = M / B by defining B, the claims \nbasis for the time period T to be: \n \n B = (U1 x R) + (U2 x P) + (U3 x C) \n \nThus, M = B x W, and W = M / B. \n \nEach component of the claims basis can be understood conceptually as the value of the \nclaims underlying the ULAE payments. Thus, \n \n\uf0b7 U1 x R represents claims basis for ULAE spent setting up new claims \n\uf0b7 U2 x P represents claims basis for ULAE spent maintaining open claims \n\uf0b7 U3 x C represents claims basis for ULAE spent closing existing claims \n \nIn practice, insurers typically measure and report M, the ULAE payments during a period, on a \ncalendar year basis. Once U1, U2, and U3 are estimated or selected, the claims basis B can be \ncalculated from claim amounts R, P, and C, that can typically be determined from data and \ncalculations underlying an actuarial analysis for estimating unpaid claims. In particular, M (total \nULAE payments) and B (claim basis) can be calculated for historical calendar periods.
