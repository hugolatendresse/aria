For example, assume that the actuary wants to re-estimate \nwhat the claim liabilities were at December 31, 2006, taking into account the actual experience of \n2007 and 2008. The actuary can use a December 31, 2008 valuation date and thus include actual \npaid and reported claims experience through 2007 and 2008. When estimating the unpaid claims \nat December 31, 2006 (the accounting date), the actuary subtracts the actual payments at \nDecember 31, 2006 from the projected ultimate claims that he or she derives using data through \nDecember 31, 2008 (the valuation date).  \n \n \nAggregation by Calendar Year \n \nCalendar year data is transactional data.  For example, calendar year 2008 paid claims refer to \nthe claim payments made by the insurer between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. \nSimilarly, calendar year 2008 reported claims are the 2008 payments plus the change in case \noutstanding (ending case outstanding at December 31, 2008 minus beginning case outstanding at \nJanuary 1, 200818). Reported claim counts for the 2008 calendar year represent those claim counts \nreported during the January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 period; and closed claim counts \nrepresent the number of claims closed during the year.  \n \nThe primary uses of calendar year data for the actuary are the aggregation of exposures and \ndiagnostic testing when analyzing accident year claims data. Calendar year 2008 written premium \nis simply the sum of all written premium reported/recorded in the accounting systems during  \n                                                 \n18 The actual accounting equation uses ending case outstanding at December 31, 2007, but this is generally \nsynonymous with beginning reserves at January 1, 2008. \n39", "type": "Document"}}
