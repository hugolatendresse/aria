KN \nN Z \uf02b\uf03d  \nN represents the number of \nobservations, and K is the \nexpected value of the process \nvariance (EVPV) divided by \nthe variance of the \nhypothetical means (VHM).  \nThe ratio K can be described \nmore simply as the ratio of \nthe average risk variance and \nthe variance between risks.  In \npractice, K can be difficult to \ncalculate.  The EVPV and \nVHM can be derived from a \nmodel or estimated based on \ndata. The former case is \nsubject to model error, while \nthe latter case is subject to \nrandom fluctuation.  Further commentary on the calculation of K is beyond the scope of this text.  Chart \n12.2 shows the sensitivity of the derived credibility for three different values of K. \nSince K is a constant for a given situation, the credibility will meet the criteria listed earlier in the chapter.  \nThe chart demonstrates this visually.   \nFor B\u00fchlmann credibility, Z \napproaches 1.0 \nasymptotically as N gets \nlarger, whereas the classical \ncredibility measure equals \n1.0 at the point the number of  \nclaims or exposures equals \nthe full credibility standard \n(denoted Nf)  and thereafter.  \nChart 12.3 shows a \ncomparison of the credibility \nat different numbers of \nobservations (N) under \nclassical and B\u00fchlmann \napproaches.   \nFor these specific values of \nNf and K and for a relatively small number of observations, the B\u00fchlmann credibility estimate is closest to", "type": "Document"}}
