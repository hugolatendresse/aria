An important assumption underlying the ratio analysis is that the relationship \nbetween ALAE and claims only is relatively stable over the experience period. The actuary \nshould confirm this assumption during his or her data gathering process and specifically during \ndiscussions with management. A change in defense strategy or a new policy with respect to the \nuse of external versus internal defense counsel are two examples of changes that could result in \ndifficulties in using historical relationships to project future ALAE experience. \n \nWhile an advantage of the ratio method is that it recognizes the relationship between ALAE and \nclaims only, a disadvantage is that any error in the estimate of ultimate claims only could affect \nthe estimate of ultimate ALAE. Another potential challenge with a ratio method exists for some \nlines of business where large amounts of ALAE may be spent on claims that ultimately settle with \nno claim payment. In previous chapters, we discuss the importance of reviewing large claims and \npossibly projecting estimates of unpaid large claims separately. Similar comments apply to the \nanalysis of unpaid ALAE with respect to large expenses as for large claims. \n \nAn advantage of the ratio approach (noted previously in our discussion of salvage and \nsubrogation) is that the ratio development factors tend not to be as highly leveraged as the \ndevelopment factors based on paid ALAE dollars. We select age-to-age factors based on the \nsimple average of the latest three years. Initially, we select a tail factor of 1.00 for the ratio of \npaid ALAE-to-paid claims based on the absence of development seen at 108-to-120 months. We \nwill see that this method produces projected ultimate ALAE that are less than the reported and", "type": "Document"}}
