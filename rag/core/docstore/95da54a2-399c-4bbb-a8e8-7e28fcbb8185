Since the \nexpense constant is a flat dollar amount, it is a decreasing percentage of written premium as the size of the \npolicy increases.   \nFinally, workers compensation insurers apply a premium discount to policies with premium above a \nspecified amount.  The following table shows the calculation of the premium discount for a policy with \nstandard premium of $400,000. \n                                                      \n40 Standard premium is a term defined by the National Council of Compensation Insurers (NCCI).
