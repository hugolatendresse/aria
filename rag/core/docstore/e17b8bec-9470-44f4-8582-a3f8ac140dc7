In the example, the \nrate relativity for Territory 1 developed using the loss ratio method is higher than the true relativity \nbecause the process by which it takes into account the high proportion of high-valued homes relies on the \ncurrent amount of insurance relativities that are under-priced.  The downside to this adjustment is that all \nhomes in Territory 1, not just the high-value homes, are being charged an extra amount to correct for the \ninequity in amount of insurance relativities.    \nAdjusted\tPure\tPremium\tApproach\t\nThe loss ratio approach requires the actuary to obtain premium at current rate level for each level of the \nvariable being analyzed.  In some cases it may not be practical to obtain premium at that level of \nrefinement; consequently, it will be necessary to use the pure premium approach rather than the loss ratio \n9.12 Result Comp arison\nTerr\nTrue \nRelativity\nPure \nPremium \nIndication\nLos s  Ratio \nIndication\n10 . 6 3 1 2 0 . 7 5 2 6 0 . 6 5 4 0\n21 . 0 0 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 0\n31 . 2 3 6 5 1 . 0 9 2 9 1 . 2 0 4 9", "type": "Document"}}
