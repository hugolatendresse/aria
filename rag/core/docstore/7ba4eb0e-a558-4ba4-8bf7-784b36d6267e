This technique \nachieves each of the benefits of multivariate methods listed above.  Though less transparent than the \ncruder and less accurate univariate results, it still scores favorably in comparison to other multivariate \nmethods such as neural networks.  Not only can the iterations of a GLM be tracked, but the output of a \nmultiplicative GLM is a series of multipliers\u2014much like the insurance industry is accustomed to using in \nrating algorithms and rating manuals. \nA\tMathematical\tFoundation\tfor\tGLMs:\t\tLinear\tModels\t\nThough touted above as a relatively transparent method, many practitioners familiar with the traditional \nunivariate approaches may not understand the statistical underpinnings of GLMs.  A good foundation for \nunderstanding GLMs is to first review linear models (LMs), something many actuaries may have studied \nin college coursework.  Both LMs and GLMs aim to express the relationship between an observed \nresponse variable (Y) and a number of explanatory variables, referred to as predictor variables.  For \nexample, the response variable may be claim frequency for homeowners insurance, and the predictor \nvariables may include amount of insurance, age of home, and deductible.  The observations in the data \n(e.g., claims on individual exposures) are considered a realization of the response variable. \nLinear models express the response variable (Y) as the sum of its mean (\u00b5) and a random variable (\u03b5), \nalso known as the error term: \n\u03b5.\u03bcY \uf02b\uf03d  \nThey assume that the mean can be written as a linear combination of the predictor variables.
