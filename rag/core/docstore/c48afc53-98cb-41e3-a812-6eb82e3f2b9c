For example, for some third-party liability lines of \ninsurance, defense and expert witness costs may occur on an ongoing basis during the period of \ninvestigation and well before any claim payment to the claimant. Furthermore, some defense and \nsettlement costs may lag the payment to the injured party. Thus, combining claim amount with \nALAE for such lines of business can present challenges similar to combining two lines of \nbusiness with non-homogeneous experience.  \n \nIn Chapter 3 \u2013 Understanding the Types of Data Used in the Estimation of Unpaid Claims, we \nstate: \u201cWe cannot emphasize strongly enough how critical it is for the actuary to fully understand \nthe types of data generated by the insurer\u2019s information systems.\u201d This comment is equally \napplicable for the actuary gathering data for an analysis of unpaid ALAE. The actuary must \nunderstand the definition of ALAE used by the insurer and ensure that such definition has not \nchanged over the experience period. The actuary must also understand how changes in the \ninsurer\u2019s operations and/or policies may have affected the historical ALAE experience.  \n \n \n                                                 \n88 Foundations of Casualty Actuarial Science, 2001. \n370", "type": "Document"}}
