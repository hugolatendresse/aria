Also, a decision should be made whether to include claims that \nclosed without payment.   \nSeverity is a measure of the average loss per claim.  If the 7,500 claims above produced $18,750,000 of \nreported losses as of 18 months, the reported severity as of 18 months is $2,500 (= $18,750,000 / 7,500).  \nThe two components of this ratio, losses and claims, can be described and aggregated in various ways\u2014\ne.g., paid or reported losses; reported, paid, or closed claims with or without claims that closed without \npayment.  In addition, actuaries pricing certain lines of business may use losses developed to ultimate in \ntheir severity measures (loss development adjustments will be covered later in this chapter).  The \nratemaking actuary should give careful thought to how to define severity and be clear in communications \nto avoid confusion.  \nPure premium (also known as loss cost or burning cost) is a measure of the average loss per exposure.  \nIt is calculated as the total losses divided by total exposures; this is equivalent to the product of frequency \nand severity.  As with frequency and severity, this calculation involves a choice of relevant statistics.  The \nchoice should be consistent with those in the underlying frequency and severity ratios (e.g., if paid claims \nwere used as the numerator of frequency, they should also be used as the denominator of severity).  In the \nexample above, the pure premium as of 18 months is $18,750,000 / 150,000 = $125 = 0.05 x $2,500. \nLoss ratio is the ratio of losses (or losses and LAE) to premium, which measures the portion of each \npremium dollar needed to pay losses (or to pay losses and LAE).  This metric varies depending on the \ntypes of premium and loss used, and the method of aggregation; furthermore, the numerator may or may \nnot include loss adjustment expenses or be developed to ultimate loss levels.
