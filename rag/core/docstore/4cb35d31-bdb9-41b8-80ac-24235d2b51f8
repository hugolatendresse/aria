The unit \nshould be refined enough to be relatively homogenous with respect to geographic differences while still \nhaving some observations in most units.  Typical units are postal codes (zip codes in the U.S.), census \nblocks, counties, or some combination of these.  Each of these options has practical advantages and \ndisadvantages.  For example, while zip codes have the advantage of being the most readily available, they \nhave the disadvantage of changing over time.  Counties have the advantage of being static and readily \navailable; however, due to the large size of most counties, they tend to contain very heterogeneous risks.  \nCensus blocks are relatively static over time, but require a process to map insurance policies to the census \nblocks.    \nOnce the basic geographic unit is determined, the actuary\u2019s objective is to estimate the geographic risk \nassociated with each unit.  Actual experience reflects \nboth signal and random noise.  The signal is driven by \nnon-geographic elements (e.g., age, amount of \ninsurance, number of employees) and geographic \nelements (e.g., density, weather indices, crime rates).  \nThe different components are shown in Figure 11.1; the \nkey to accurately estimating the geographic risk is \nisolating the geographic signal in the data.   \nCalculating\tthe\tGeographic\tEstimator\t\nTraditionally, the actuary used univariate techniques (e.g., pure premium approach) to develop an \nestimator for each geographic unit.  There are two major issues with this approach.  First, the geographic \nestimator in this approach reflects both the signal and the noise.  Since geographic units tend to be small, \nthe data is often sparse and either the resulting loss ratios or pure premiums or both will typically be too \nvolatile to distinguish the noise from the signal.  Second, since location tends to be highly correlated with", "type": "Document"}}
