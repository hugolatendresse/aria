As the number of workers increases \n(decreases) or the average number of hours worked increases (decreases), both payroll and the risk of loss \nincrease (decrease) too.  Thus, the exposure base (i.e., payroll) moves in proportion to expected losses, \nand the premium will change with this exposure base change as well. \nPractical\t\nThe exposure base should be practical.  In other words, the selected base should be objective and \nrelatively easy and inexpensive to obtain and verify.  By meeting these criteria, the exposure base will be \nconsistently measured.   \nA well-defined and objective exposure base also precludes policyholders and producers/underwriters \nfrom manipulating exposure information for their own benefit through intentional dishonest disclosure.   \nFor example, asking a personal auto policyholder to declare estimated annual miles provides more \nopportunity for dishonesty than the use of car-years.  This circumstance is referred to as moral hazard.  \nAdvances in technology, however, may change the choice of exposure base for personal auto insurance.  \nOnboard diagnostic devices can accurately track driving patterns and transmit this information to \ninsurance companies.  As this technology becomes more prevalently used, personal auto insurers may \nconsider miles driven as an alternative exposure base.  In fact, some commercial long haul trucking \ncarriers have implemented miles driven as an exposure base. \nFor products liability, the exposure base that is intuitively the most proportional to expected loss is the \nnumber of products currently in use.  While companies normally know how many products were sold \nduring specific time periods, it is difficult for most companies to accurately track how many of their \nproducts are actually being used during the period covered by the insurance policy.
