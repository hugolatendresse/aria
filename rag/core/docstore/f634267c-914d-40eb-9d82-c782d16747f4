Chapter 13 discusses conditions that may cause selections \nof overall rate levels or rate differentials to deviate from indicated. \nThe next sections of this chapter use a simple example to illustrate the calculation of the fixed expense \nfees and the derivation of the base rate. \nExample\tRating\tAlgorithm\t\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, the rating algorithm describes in detail how to combine the various rate \ncomponents (e.g., base rates, rate differentials, expense fees, and other additive premium) to calculate the \noverall premium charged for any risk.  Rating algorithms vary considerably by company and by product, \nand the determination of the most appropriate rating algorithm47 is outside the scope of this text.  When \nusing any of the formulae described in this chapter, consider the specific rating algorithm of the product \nbeing priced, and modify as necessary. \nThe portion of the total premium that varies by risk characteristics (i.e., is a function of the base rate and \nrate differentials) is often referred to as variable premium.  The portion of the premium derived from \nexpense fees and other dollar additives is often referred to as flat or additive premium.  These terms will \nbe used throughout the remainder of the chapter. \nFor the purpose of explaining the expense fee and base rate derivation formulae, assume a simple rating \nalgorithm that includes a base rate (B), two multiplicative rating variables (R1 and R2), two discounts (D1 \nand D2) that are subtracted from one and applied multiplicatively in the rating algorithm, and an additive \nper exposure expense fee (A).  As before, P and X are used to denote premium and exposures, \nrespectively.  Using a subscript of P to refer to proposed and the subscripts of i, j, k, m to refer to different", "type": "Document"}}
