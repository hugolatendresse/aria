We discussed the importance of adjusting premiums to an on-level basis when selecting expected \nclaim ratios. The purpose of adjusting premiums to an on-level basis is to develop a proxy for the \nunderlying exposures in each year of the experience period. An alternative to the use of premiums and \nclaim ratios for developing expected claims is exposures and pure premiums (also referred to as loss rates \nor loss costs). Many actuaries who work with self-insurers rely on such an approach. Due to enhancements \nin many insurers\u2019 data systems, historical exposures may become more readily available to actuaries and \ncan thus be directly incorporated into the development of expected claims for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \ntechnique. \n153", "type": "Document"}}
