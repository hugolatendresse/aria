The \nfirst opinion requirements emanated in 1980 from a limited number of state regulations. \n \nIn 1990, the NAIC began requiring that most P&C insurers in the U.S. obtain a Statement of \nActuarial Opinion signed by a qualified actuary. The statement contains the qualified actuary\u2019s \nopinion regarding the reasonableness of the carried statutory loss and loss adjustment expense \n(LAE) reserves as shown in the statutory annual statement. In 1993, qualified actuaries signing \nstatements of opinion started using the title of Appointed Actuary because the NAIC required that \nthey must be appointed by the Board of Directors or its equivalent. \n \n \nOther U.S.-Regulated Entities \n \nOther U.S. non-NAIC regulated entities also require actuarial opinions. For example, many state \ninsurance departments require opinions for captive insurers, self-insurers, and self-insurance \npools as well as some underwriting pools and associations.3 \n \n \nCanada \n \nIn Canada, the Insurance Companies Act requires all federally regulated insurers to have an \nAppointed Actuary. The first responsibility of the Appointed Actuary, as set out in the Insurance \nCompanies Act, is to value the actuarial and other policy liabilities of the company at the end of a \nfinancial year. The Appointed Actuary\u2019s valuation must be in accordance with generally accepted \nactuarial practice, which means complying with the rules and the standards set by the Canadian", "type": "Document"}}
