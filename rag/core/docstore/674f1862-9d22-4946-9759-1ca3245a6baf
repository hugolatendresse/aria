The relativities in this column have the \nsame overall weighted average as the current relativities.  As discussed in the pure premium approach, it \nis sometimes useful to compare the current, indicated, and competitors\u2019 relativities for a variable.  In such \ncases, each set of relativities should be adjusted so that the overall weighted-average relativity is the \nsame.  The proper weight for making this adjustment is the premium adjusted to the base class for the \nvariable being analyzed (i.e., the premium divided by the current relativity for that variable).  Column 8 \nadjusts the relativities to the base level by dividing the indicated relativity for each level by the indicated \nrelativity at the base level.  \nDistortion\t\nThe true underlying relativities and the indicated relativities from both the pure premium and loss ratio \nmethods are as follows: \n \nWhile the indicated territorial relativities from the loss ratio method do not match the true relativities, \nthey are closer than those calculated using the pure premium approach.  Since the pure premium approach \nrelies on exposures (i.e., one exposure for each house year), the risks in each territory are treated the same \nregardless of the amount of insurance.  In contrast, the use of premium in the denominator of the loss ratio \nreflects the fact that the insurer collects more premium for homes with higher amounts of insurance.  \nUsing the current premium helps adjust for the distributional bias.  Even so, the loss ratio method still did \nnot produce the correct relativities.  The remaining distortion reflects the variation for the amount of \ninsurance relativities being charged rather than the true variation.  If the current amount of insurance \nrelativities are equivalent to the true amount of insurance relativities, then the loss ratio method will \nproduce the true territorial relativities.", "type": "Document"}}
