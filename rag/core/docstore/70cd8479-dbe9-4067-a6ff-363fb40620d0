Small discrepancies may \nexist between the text and table entries when the text is summarizing multiple calculations within a table \nor further dissecting calculations in a table for illustrative purposes. \nORGANIZATION\tOF\tTHIS\tTEXT\t\nThis text is organized into sixteen chapters plus six appendices.  The chapters discuss various ratemaking \nconcepts and techniques, and provide simple examples.  Each chapter concludes with a narrative \nsummary as well as an outline of key concepts covered in the chapter.  The appendices provide in-depth \npractical examples of some of the techniques discussed throughout the text.  In order to reinforce the \nconcepts and techniques discussed in the body of the text, the authors suggest Appendices A-D be read \nupon completion of Chapter 8, and Appendices E-F be read upon completion of Chapters 9-10.   \nBelow is a summary of the content of each chapter and appendix. \nChapter 1 provides an overview of P&C insurance ratemaking, highlighting the unique relationship \nbetween price, cost, and profit.  This overview includes basic P&C insurance terms and commonly used \ninsurance ratios.  This chapter also introduces the fundamental insurance equation, a key concept that is \nreferenced frequently in other chapters.  This concept states that premium charged for policies written \nduring a future time period should be appropriate to cover the losses and expenses expected for those \npolicies while achieving the targeted profit. \nChapter 2 discusses the P&C insurer rating manual, an aid for anyone who needs to understand the \nprocess of calculating an insurance premium.  The four main components of P&C insurer rating manuals \nare rules, rate pages, rating algorithms, and underwriting guidelines.  The chapter also includes three \nrating manual examples for different insurance lines of business.", "type": "Document"}}
