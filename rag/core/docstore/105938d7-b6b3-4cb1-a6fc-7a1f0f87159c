If the insured assumes \nresponsibility, the insurer should evaluate the insured\u2019s claim handling expertise to determine the \nlikelihood of claims leakage above the deductible; any material increase in expected costs as a \nresult of the insured\u2019s inexperience should be reflected in the pricing.   \n\uf0b7 Application of the deductible:  The deductible may apply only to losses or to the sum of losses \nand allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE).  The calculation of loss elimination ratios should \nbe based on data consistent with the treatment of ALAE in the policy terms.   \n\uf0b7 Deductible processing:  In some large deductible policies the insurer is responsible for paying \nthe entire claim and seeking reimbursement for amounts below the deductible from the insured.  \nIn these situations, the premium should reflect the cost of invoicing and monitoring deductible \nactivity as well as a provision associated with the risk that the insured may become bankrupt and \nbe unable to pay for any future deductible invoices (i.e., credit risk).  In some instances, collateral \nis received to cover potentially uncollectible deductible amounts; however, it is rare that this \ncredit risk is fully collateralized.  \n\uf0b7 Risk margin:  While the proper treatment and computation of profit is beyond the scope of this \npaper, it should be noted that losses above a large deductible are expected to be more uncertain \nthan losses below the deductible.  As a result, the profit margin may need to be adjusted \naccordingly to reflect the increased risk being assumed by the insurer.   \nWith the exception of these considerations, pricing for a large deductible policy is otherwise the same as \npricing a standard deductible, which is addressed in Chapter 11.", "type": "Document"}}
