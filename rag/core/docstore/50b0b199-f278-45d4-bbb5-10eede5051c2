The evidence of \nchange in average paid claims only at 12, 24, and 36 months is consistent with our earlier \ncomment that insurers typically have the greatest control on closure rates of the less complicated \nand less expensive claims. Closing more complex claims is usually dependent on the actions of \nthird parties that are not within the insurer\u2019s control. \n \nFinally, we review the average case outstanding (or average open claim amount) triangle. The \naverage case outstanding triangle is one of the most important diagnostic tools for testing changes \nin case outstanding adequacy. In this triangle, a decreasing pattern down the column is an \nindicator of potential weakening in the case outstanding, and an increasing pattern down the \ncolumn is an indicator of possible strengthening in the case outstanding. \n \nTable 14 \u2013 Average Case Outstanding Development Triangle \nAccident Average Case Outstanding as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 \n2002 9,213 13,714 18,151 33,273 56,167 91,729 120,366 \n2003 6,634 10,733 25,647 48,766 79,718 82,826  \n2004 8,706 22,941 41,561 71,204 76,320   \n2005 14,464 29,994 61,547 68,983    \n2006 20,185 47,368 56,984     \n2007 18,480 42,002      \n2008 20,031       \n \nBefore drawing any conclusions, however, it is important that the actuary understands the \ndynamics of the insurer. Has there been a change in case outstanding practices, policies, \nphilosophy, staff, or senior management of the claims department? Any of these changes could \naffect case outstanding adequacy. The average case outstanding could also be changing due to \nchanges in the mix of business in the portfolio that have nothing to do with changes in case \noutstanding strength.  \n \nThis is why it is so important that the actuary looks at more than one diagnostic tool before", "type": "Document"}}
