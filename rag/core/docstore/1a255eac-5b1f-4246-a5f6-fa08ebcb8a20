The indicated pure premiums are calculated by dividing the historical losses and \nALAE by the exposures for each territory.  In this simple example, trend and development have been \nignored.  Column 5 displays the indicated relativities, which are calculated as the pure premium for each \nterritory divided by the total pure premium.  This value represents the indicated relationship between the \ngiven territory and the total.  Normally, as discussed in Chapter 2, companies select a base level for each \nrating variable, and all other levels for that rating variable are expressed relative to the base.  In this case, \nthe indicated relativities to the base class (assuming Territory 2 is the base territory) are determined by \ndividing the indicated relativity for each territory by the indicated relativity for Territory 2.  This result is \ndisplayed in Column 6. \nClearly, Column 6 can be calculated directly from Column 4.  The interim step was included as \ncompanies will typically compare current, indicated, and competitors\u2019 relativities all normalized so that \nthe total average exposure-weighted relativity is 1.00 for each.  By doing this, the relativities can be \ncompared on a consistent basis.  This consistent basis is also relevant when indicated relativities are \ncredibility-weighted with other experience (as discussed in Chapter 12). \nAs stated, all expenses were assumed to be variable, and the variable expense and target profit provisions \nwere assumed to apply uniformly to all risks and thereby excluded from the calculations.   \nDistortion\t\nThe true underlying pure premium relativities and the relativities indicated by the pure premium analysis \nare as follows: \n9.10 Result Comparison\nTerr\nTrue \nRelativity\nPure \nPremium \nIndication\n10 . 6 3 1 2      0.7526       \n21 . 0 0 0 0      1.0000       \n31 . 2 3 6 5    1.0929", "type": "Document"}}
