We present this triangle in the top part of Exhibit V, \nSheet 4. Each ratio represents the percentage of ultimate claim counts that are closed at a given \nstage of maturity for a given accident year.  \n \nIn the middle part of Exhibit V, Sheet 4, we calculate various averages of the disposal rates by \nmaturity age; we use the medial five-year average to select a disposal rate at each maturity age.  \nFor our example, we observe considerable stability in the disposal rates at each maturity. The \nfollowing table summarizes the selected disposal rates at maturities 12 months through 96 \nmonths. We generally expect disposal rates to monotonically increase over time, as evidenced by \nthe disposal rates in the following table. \n206", "type": "Document"}}
