There was no \nactivity on Claim IDs 1 through 3. However the reported claim for Claim ID 4 continues to \nincrease. This was a late-reported claim. At December 31, 2006, the case outstanding was $1,000 \nfor this claim. By December 31, 2007, the case outstanding had increased to $1,200. There were \nno payments in either 2006 or 2007. In 2008, claim payments were $300 but there was no change \nin the ending case outstanding. Thus, the reported claim for this particular claim increased by \n$300 during 2008 from $1,200 (the sum of cumulative claim payments through December 31, \n2007, $0, and ending unpaid case at December 31, 2007, $1,200) to $1,500 (the sum of \ncumulative claim payments through December 31, 2008, $300, and ending unpaid case at \nDecember 31, 2008, $1,200). \n \nA similar review can take place with the claims experience of each accident year. \n \n \nReported Claim Count Development Triangle \n \nWe also use the data in Table 5 to build a reported claim count triangle. \n \nTable 12 \u2013 Reported Claim Count Development Triangle \nAccident Reported Claim Counts as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 \n2005 3 4 4 4 \n2006 2 3 3  \n2007 3 4   \n2008 3    \n \nWe describe how to build the claim count development triangle by using accident years 2005 and \n2008 as examples. Based on the data in Table 5, we note that while there are 4 claims for 2005, \nonly 3 of the claims were reported as of December 31, 2005. Thus, the first cell in the reported \nclaim count triangle which represents accident year 2005 as of December 31, 2005 shows 3 \nclaims reported. By December 31, 2006, all four claims were reported. No further claims were \nreported for accident year 2005, and thus the number of reported claims remains unchanged at 4 \nfor ages 36 months and 48 months. \n \nThe final row of the reported claim count triangle is for accident year 2008 as of December 31,", "type": "Document"}}
