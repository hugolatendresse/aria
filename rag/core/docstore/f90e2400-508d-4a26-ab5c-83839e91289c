Exhibit II \ncontains the expected claims projections for the aggregated results of U.S. private passenger \nautomobile insurance (i.e., U.S. Industry Auto). We rely on the selected reported and paid claim \ndevelopment factors from Chapter 7 to develop an initial selection of ultimate claims. Columns \n(2) through (7) present detailed calculations for the reported and paid claim development \nprojections. We derive the initial selected ultimate claims in Column (8) based on the average of \nthe reported and paid claim development projections.  \n \nWe then divide the initial selected ultimate claims by earned premium for each year to develop \nthe estimated claim ratios (Column 10). Since the data in Exhibit II represents the consolidated \nresults for the entire U.S. insurance industry, we do not have detailed information regarding rate \nchanges and thus can not adjust the premium to an on-level basis.  \n \nThe example in Exhibit II differs somewhat from the prior two examples in this chapter in the time \nperiod for which the expected claims method is used. In the first two examples, we use historical \nexperience to select an expected claim ratio and an expected pure premium for the 2008 accident \nyear only. Thus, we adjusted the exposures and claims for each year in the experience period to the \n2008 cost level. In the example for U.S. Industry Auto, we are projecting ultimate claims for each \nyear in the experience period based on the expected claims technique. Thus, we require a claim \nratio at the cost level expected for each year in the experience period. While it is still advisable for \nthe most recent years to review estimated claim ratios from prior years on a trended and adjusted \nbasis, many actuaries use significant judgment when selecting expected claim ratios.
