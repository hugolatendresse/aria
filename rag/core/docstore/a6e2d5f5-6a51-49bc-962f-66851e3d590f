One of the main advantages of GLMs is that they are transparent; the model output \nincludes parameter estimates for each level of each explanatory variable in the model, as well as a range \nof statistical diagnostics.  Other multivariate techniques, such as neural networks (also discussed briefly \nlater in this chapter) are often criticized for a lack of transparency.  No matter how sophisticated the \nmathematics underlying a method, it is important for practitioners to be able to follow and communicate \nhow the results were developed and be able to translate the results into something that can be \nimplemented in the insurance company\u2019s operations.   \nSo how do the methods mentioned thus far stack up to this list of benefits?  As discussed, the results of \nunivariate approaches are distorted by distributional biases.  The results can also be heavily distorted by \nunsystematic effects (noise).  The result is a set of answers with no additional information about the \ncertainty of the results.  Interactions can be incorporated but only by expanding the analysis into two-way \nor three-way tables.  Perhaps it scores high only in terms of transparency, but this is overshadowed by the \ninaccuracies of the method. \nIn contrast, the minimum bias methods account for an uneven mix of business but, as stated previously, \nthe iterative calculations are considered computationally inefficient.  As with one-way analysis, no \ndiagnostics are included.  This method scores high on transparency and outperforms univariate analysis in \nterms of accuracy, but does not provide all of the benefits of full multivariate methods.", "type": "Document"}}
