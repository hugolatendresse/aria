Instead of making the time-consuming adjustments, the actuary \ncan use a fixed expense projection method based on exposures or number of policies. \nEXPOSURE/POLICY\u2010BASED\tPROJECTION\tMETHOD\t\nIn this approach, variable expenses are treated the same way as the Premium-based Projection Method, \nbut historical fixed expenses are divided by historical exposures or policy count rather than premium.  \nThis methodology uses the concepts outlined by Diana Childs and Ross Currie in \u201cExpense Allocation in \nInsurance Ratemaking\u201d (Currie 1980).  \nIf fixed expenses are assumed to be constant for each exposure, the historical expenses are divided by \nexposures.  On the other hand, if fixed expenses are assumed to be constant for each policy, then \nhistorical expenses are divided by the number of policies.  Table 7.5 shows the development of the fixed \nand variable expenses for the general expenses category.  (The example in this section uses exposures, but \nthe procedure is exactly the same if policy counts are used instead.)        \n \nAs with the Premium-based Projection Method, the expenses are split into variable and fixed components.  \nThe same assumption that 75% of general expenses are fixed is used.26  The fixed expenses are then \ndivided by the exposures for that same time period.  As general expenses in this example are assumed to \nbe incurred throughout the policy, the expense dollars are divided by earned exposures rather than written \nexposures to determine an average expense per exposure for the indicated historical period.     \nTable 7.6 shows the data used for this procedure for each expense category.", "type": "Document"}}
