Some of the most common types of data include: \n \n\uf0be Incremental paid claims \n\uf0be Cumulative paid claims \n\uf0be Paid claims on closed claims \n\uf0be Paid claims on open claims \n\uf0be Case outstanding \n\uf0be Reported claims (i.e., sum of cumulative paid claims plus case outstanding) \n\uf0be Incremental reported claims \n\uf0be Reported claim counts \n\uf0be Claim counts on closed with payment  \n\uf0be Claim counts on closed with no payment  \n\uf0be Open claim counts \n\uf0be Reopened claim counts \n \nWe can use all of the above data types with claims only (i.e., losses only), claim-related expenses, \nor claims and claim-related expenses combined.  \n \n \nClaim-Related Expenses \n \nThe actuary needs to know how the insurer handles expenses before using the data.  Where the \nclaim data and policy limits include claim adjustment expenses, many actuaries combine \nhistorical claims and ALAE experience when conducting analyses of unpaid claims. Unless \notherwise indicated, we use the term claims to denote both claims and ALAE combined. When \nthe claim analysis includes only ALAE and not ULAE, the actuary needs to perform a separate \nanalysis to evaluate the unpaid ULAE estimate.  \n \nThere are multiple ways to classify claim-related expenses, not just the one generic ALAE/ULAE \nsplit. As mentioned in Chapter 1 \u2013 Overview, in the U.S., for statutory reporting purposes, \ninsurers categorize LAE as either defense and cost containment (DCC) or as adjusting and other \n(A&O). The DCC versus A&O split depends on the function of the expenses. A&O includes all", "type": "Document"}}
