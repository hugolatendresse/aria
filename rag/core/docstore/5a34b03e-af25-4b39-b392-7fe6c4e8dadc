As stated in earlier chapters, this relationship is described by the fundamental \ninsurance equation: \n.

This chapter will \ndemonstrate how to combine the various estimated components to ascertain whether the current rates are \nappropriate (i.e., whether the profit target is likely to be met at the current rates).  Please note that the \ntechniques in this chapter are focused on whether the rates are appropriate in the aggregate.  In other \nwords, the focus is to determine appropriate overall indicated rates or indicated rate level changes.  \nChapters 9-11 discuss the calculation of indications by subclasses of insureds.  Chapter 14 details how to \ncalculate final rates based on the overall indications and indications by subclasses of insureds. \nThere are two basic approaches for determining an overall rate level need: \n1. Pure premium method \n2. Loss ratio method \n \nThis chapter will discuss each of these in detail, demonstrate the mathematical equivalency of the \napproaches, and discuss rationale for selecting one over the other. \nPURE\tPREMIUM\tMETHOD\t\t\nThe pure premium method is generally considered the simpler and more direct of the two ratemaking \nformulae as it determines an indicated average rate, not an indicated change to the current average rate.  \nThe pure premium method involves projecting the average loss and loss adjustment expenses per", "type": "Document"}}
