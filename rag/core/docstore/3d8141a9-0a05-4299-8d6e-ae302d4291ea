Assume f(x) represents a continuous \ndistribution of losses of size x, and D is the size of the deductible.  The eliminated losses equal the sum of \nall losses less than the deductible D and the deductible amount for every loss that exceeds D. \nThis formula is very similar to the formula used in the increased limit factor section and calculates the \nexpected loss eliminated through the application of a deductible, D. \ndx.f(x)Ddxxf(x)\nD\nD\n\uf0f2\uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf02b\n0\n \nThe LER is calculated by dividing this formula by the unlimited expected loss: \n.)LER(\n0\n0\ndxxf(x)\nf(x)dxDxf(x)dx\nD D\nD\n\uf0f2\n\uf0f2\uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf0a5\n\uf02b\n\uf03d  \nPractical\tConsiderations \nLike the ILF pricing, the LER approach assumes claiming behavior will be the same for each deductible.  \nThis may not be the case.  The LER approach assumes an insured with a $250 deductible and an insured \nwith a $1,000 deductible will both report a $1,100 loss.  In reality, the same insured who reports the claim \nunder a $250 deductible policy may choose not to report the claim under a $1,000 deductible policy for \nfear of an increase in premium from the insurer applying a claim surcharge (i.e., the small net payment of \n$100 is not worth the increase in premium).  This difference in behavior is ignored in loss elimination \nratio calculations.   \nFurthermore, when insureds are allowed to freely choose their policy deductible, lower-risk insureds tend \nto choose higher deductibles.  Presumably, those insureds realize they are unlikely to have a claim and are \nwilling to accept the risk associated with a higher deductible.  Since the LER approach does not recognize \nthese behavioral differences, higher deductible policies may end up being more profitable than lower \ndeductible policies.   \nIf insureds are not allowed to self-select and are forced to purchase higher deductibles, this phenomena", "type": "Document"}}
