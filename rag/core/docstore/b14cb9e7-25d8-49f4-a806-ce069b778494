Special thanks go to my \nKPMG colleagues Rachel Dutil and Edward Lam. Rachel read, proofed, critiqued, modified, and \nultimately improved each and every draft version of this text. Her contributions were tremendous \nat every step of the process. Edward Lam prepared all of the supporting exhibits and assisted with \nmuch of the research required for the text. He also reviewed most, if not all, of the draft versions. \nThis text could not have been completed in such a timely manner without their invaluable input. \n \nI also want to thank my KPMG colleagues in Toronto and the United States who assisted in \nreviewing various versions of the text. Each member of the KPMG Toronto Actuarial Practice \nwas involved at one point or another in reviewing this text. Thanks to members of the CAS Task \nForce for their input and feedback. Finally, I want to acknowledge the significant contributions of \nRalph Blanchard, Edward Y. Yao, Wynand Viljoen, and Eugene van der Westhuizen. Their \ninternational experience and knowledge was particularly valuable in ensuring that the text will \nhave relevance for actuaries practicing throughout the world. \n \nThe objective of the CAS in creating a new text that addressed the estimation of unpaid claims \nwas to replace a number of readings that existed on the syllabus of basic education as of 2007 \nwith a single educational publication. Thus, candidates preparing for the actuarial exam \naddressing the estimation of unpaid claims using basic techniques would be able to replace \nnumerous papers, which were written over a 30-year period, with a single text. Two major \nbenefits of one educational publication are (1) consistent definitions of terms and (2) examples \nthat are used with multiple estimation techniques.
