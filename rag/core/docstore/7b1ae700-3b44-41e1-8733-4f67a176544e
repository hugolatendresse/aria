However, if there is insufficient data by subcoverage, a detailed analysis may not \nproduce a more accurate estimate of unpaid claims than the analysis based on the combined data \nfor all of the accident benefits components. Further considerations for the actuary are efficiency \nand time and resource requirements of separate versus combined analyses. The funeral benefits \nmay represent a stable portion of the total accident benefit claims and thus may not justify the \ntime and resources required for independent analysis.  \n \nWe can raise similar questions with regards to many other lines of insurance with a combination \nof coverages or benefits under one policy. For example, is it preferable to analyze claims for \nbodily injury and property damage separately or on a combined basis for general liability, or for \nautomobile liability insurance? \n \nAnother consideration regarding the homogeneity and the grouping of data relates to changes in \nthe portfolio. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to combine personal automobile and \ncommercial automobile data even though these lines typically exhibit different underlying claims \npatterns. However, if the relative volume of business is changing between these two lines of \ninsurance, the grouping may not be appropriate. In Part 3, we present an example of the effect on \nvarious projection techniques of analyzing a portfolio where the volume of personal automobile is \nincreasing at 5% per year while the commercial automobile volume is increasing at 30%.
