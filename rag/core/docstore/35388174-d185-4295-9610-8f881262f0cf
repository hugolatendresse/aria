Estimated IBNR is equal to projected ultimate claims \nless reported claims and the total unpaid claim estimate is equal to the difference between \nprojected ultimate claims and paid claims.  \n \nExhibit I, Sheet 3 displays the calculations for the estimated unpaid claims of U.S. Industry Auto. \nColumns (2) and (3) contain reported and paid claims data as of December 31, 2007. We \nsummarize the projected ultimate claims from Exhibit I, Sheet 2 in Column (4). Case outstanding, \nwhich are equal to the difference between reported claims and paid claims as of December 31, \n2007, are presented in Column (5). Estimated IBNR is equal to projected ultimate claims minus \nreported claims. We calculate the estimated IBNR based on the Cape Cod technique in Column \n(6). The total unpaid claim estimate (Column (7)) is equal to the sum of case outstanding and \nestimated IBNR. \n \n \nWhen the Cape Cod Technique Works and When it Does Not \n \nSimilar comments apply to the Cape Cod method as to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. The \nonly difference between the two methods is the derivation of the expected claims. Thus, an \nadvantage of the Cape Cod method, when compared to the development technique, is that it may \nnot be distorted by random fluctuations early in the development of an accident year (or other \ntime interval). A determining factor influencing the fluctuations, in either the Bornhuetter-\nFerguson or Cape Cod methods, is the extent to which actual claims for the most recent years \naffect the derivation of expected claims for such years. \n \nThe Cape Cod method is not necessarily as appropriate as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique if \nthe data is extremely thin or volatile or both.
