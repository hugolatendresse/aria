It is determined on the basis of the exposure, the insurer\u2019s rates, the \nexperience modification, and any premium charges excluding premium discount. \nMinimum/Maximum\tRetrospective\tPremium\t\nThe formulae for deriving the minimum and maximum retrospective premium are as follows: \nRatio. Premium Retro MaximumPremium StandardPremium Retro Maximum\nRatio,PremiumRetroMinimumPremium StandardPremium Retro Minimum\n\uf0b4\uf03d\n\uf0b4\uf03d  \nThe minimum and maximum retrospective premium ratios are subject to negotiation between the insured \nand insurer.  \t\nInsurance\tCharge\tand\tInsurance\tSavings\t\nAs stated earlier, the retrospective premium may be limited by a minimum and a maximum.  The \napplication of a minimum and maximum will affect the total premium collected by the insurer and \ntherefore the cost of doing so needs to be considered as part of the determination of the final premium.  \nThe insurance charge is the estimate of the cost associated with limiting the retrospective premium to be \nno higher than the maximum retrospective premium.  The insurance savings is the estimate of the savings \nassociated by requiring the retrospective premium to be no lower than the minimum retrospective \npremium.  The insurance charge and insurance savings are contained in a table of values.  The derivation \nof these tables is beyond the scope of this paper; however, it should be noted that the insurance charge \nand insurance savings are expressed as a percentage of expected unlimited losses.  In this example, the \nimpact of the per occurrence loss limitation is incorporated into the values contained within this table; \nhowever, there are some instances where the table represents only the effect of the maximum and \nminimum premiums, and the effect of the per occurrence loss limitation is computed as a separate \nadditional charge.", "type": "Document"}}
