For example, the expected reported claims for \naccident year 2007 during calendar year 2008 are equal to: \n \nAY07 Expected ClaimCY08 = {[($2,798 \u2013 $2,463) / (1 \u2013 0.880)] x (0.999 \u2013 0.880)} = $332 \n \nThe expected reported claims for accident year 2006 during calendar year 2008 are equal to: \n \nAY06 Expected ClaimCY08 = {[($2,952 \u2013 $2,949) / (1 \u2013 0.999)] x (1.000 \u2013 0.999)} = $3 \n \nIn the example for DC Insurer, we derive the reporting pattern based on the development factors \nto ultimate. This is a reasonable approach when selected ultimate claims for all accident years are \nbased on the reported claim development technique. However, actuaries often rely on techniques \nother than the development technique to select ultimate claims. In such situations, it is often \nvaluable to look at an alternative method for deriving reporting and payment patterns (other than \nthe inverse of the cumulative development factor). A method often used to derive payment \npatterns is to compare the historical paid claim development triangle to the final value of selected \nultimate claims. We present such a comparison for XYZ Insurer in Exhibit V, Sheet 1. Various \naverages of the percentage paid at each maturity are calculated and a payment pattern is selected. \nWe present similar calculations for the reporting pattern in Exhibit V, Sheet 2.  \n351", "type": "Document"}}
