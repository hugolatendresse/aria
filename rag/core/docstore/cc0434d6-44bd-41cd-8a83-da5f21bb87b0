Could large claims be driving the increases?  \n \n\uf0be Reported claim counts for accident years 2004 and 2005 stand out as the highest values at all \nages. This is generally consistent with the experience shown in the reported claim triangle. \nHowever, we do not observe a similar increase in the closed claim count triangle where 2006 \nand 2007 are highest at 12 months. At 24 months, the highest closed claim count values are \nfor accident years 2005 and 2006. Are the higher closed claim counts due to the new systems \nimplemented at the insurer?  \n \n\uf0be The decrease in reported claim counts for 2006 and 2007 is consistent with the decrease in \nexposures for these years. We do not see a similar decrease in closed claim counts, however. \nPerhaps, this is due to the speed-up in claims settlement processes that management discussed \nin our meetings. It is worth investigating this issue further. \n \n70", "type": "Document"}}
