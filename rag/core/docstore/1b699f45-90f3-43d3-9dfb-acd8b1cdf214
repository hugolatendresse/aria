As mentioned \nabove, this contrasts with calendar year in which written exposure and cancellation exposure can apply to \ntwo different calendar years depending on when the cancellation occurs. \nEarned exposures represent that portion of the written expos ures for which coverage has already been \nprovided as of a certain point in time.  This example inherently assumes that the probability of a claim is \nevenly distributed throughout the year.  For instance, if all policies were written on January 1 for a period \nof one year, the earned exposures as of May 31 would be 5/12 of the written exposures.   \nTo better understand the difference between calendar and policy year earned exposure, first reconsider the \ncalendar year picture: \n \nFor Policy C in our example, 75% of the policy period is earned in 2011 and 25% of the policy period is \nearned in 2012; thus, Policy C contributes 0.75 (= 75% x 1.00) of earned exposure to Calendar Year 2011 \nand 0.25 earned exposure to Calendar Year 2012.  The following chart summarizes the distribution of \nearned exposure to each calendar year: \n 4.9 Policy Year Written Exposures a/o 12/31/12\nPolicy E xposure PY 2010 PY 2011 PY 2012\nA1 0 / 0 1 / 1 0 0 9 / 3 0 / 1 1 1 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 0\nB0 1 / 0 1 / 1 1 1 2 / 3 1 / 1 1 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0\nC0 4 / 0 1 / 1 1 0 3 / 3 1 / 1 2 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0\nD0 7 / 0 1 / 1 1 0 6 / 3 0 / 1 2 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0\nE1 0 / 0 1 / 1 1 0 9 / 3 0 / 1 2 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0\nF0 1 / 0 1 / 1 2 1 2 / 3 1 / 1 2 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0\nTotal 6.00 1.00 4.00 1.00\nWritten E xposuresExpi r ati on \nDate\nEffe c ti ve  \nDate\n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D EF\n% of Policy", "type": "Document"}}
