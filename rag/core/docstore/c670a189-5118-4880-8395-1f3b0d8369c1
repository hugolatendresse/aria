Theoretically, in using the \nclassical technique, the actuary would apply 100% of the ULAE ratio to IBNYR (pure IBNR) and \n50% of the ULAE ratio to the sum of case reserves and IBNER.  \n \nSome actuaries refine the classical technique by estimating pure IBNR as a percentage of total \nIBNR or a percentage of the selected ultimate claims for the latest accident year(s).92 For \nexample, assume that pure IBNR for XYZ Insurer is equal to 5% of the latest accident year\u2019s \n(2008) ultimate claims. Given ultimate claims for accident year 2008 of $380 million, we can \ncalculate the unpaid ULAE for XYZ Insurer as follows: \n \nUnpd ULAE = [(ULAE ratio x 50% x unpd known claims) + (ULAE ratio x 100% x Pure IBNR)] \n         =  [ ( 0 . 0 4 5  x  5 0 %  x  ( c a s e  o u t s t a n d i n g  +  I B N E R ) )  +  ( 0 . 0 4 5  x  1 0 0 %  x  I B N Y R ) ]  \n \nWe calculate IBNYR claims of $19 million based on 5% of accident year 2008 ultimate claims \n(0.05 x $380 million) and derive the IBNER claims as total IBNR less IBNYR or $297 million \n($316 million - $19 million). Following the formula for the classical technique, we calculate that \nthe estimated unpaid ULAE for XYZ Insurer is $21.1 million. \n \nUnpd ULAE = [(0.045 x 50% x ($603 million + $297 million)) + (0.045 x 100% x $19 million)] \n \nThis estimate of unpaid ULAE is significantly less than the initial estimate of $27.8 million for \nXYZ insurer. (See Exhibit I, Lines (9) and (10).)  \n \nThe selected pure IBNR percentage relative to the ultimate losses of the latest accident year is \nclearly an important assumption in the above calculation. The indicated unpaid ULAE differ by \nmore than $6 million, or 24%, when the pure IBNR refinement is included in the classical", "type": "Document"}}
