Almost certainly there will continue to be more and more reliable data available publically \nfor actuaries to analyze and use in classification ratemaking.  \nSUMMARY\t\nMuch of the early history of classification ratemaking was based on rudimentary methods such as \nunivariate analysis and later iteratively standardized univariate methods such as the minimum bias \nprocedures.  As computing power and data capabilities evolved, pioneering insurance companies \nemployed multivariate methods in their classification ratemaking and moved the entire industry forward.", "type": "Document"}}
