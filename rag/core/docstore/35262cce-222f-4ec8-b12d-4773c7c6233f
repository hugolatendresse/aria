Columns (2) and (3) contain reported and paid claims data as of \nDecember 31, 2007, which are the latest diagonals in our claim development triangles. Columns \n(4) and (5) are the projected ultimate claims, which we developed in Exhibit I, Sheet 3. We \nsummarize case outstanding in Column (6); case outstanding is equal to the difference between \nreported and paid claims as of December 31, 2007 (Column (2) \u2013 Column (3)). Estimated IBNR \nis equal to projected ultimate claims minus reported claims. Estimated IBNR based on the \nreported claim development technique is calculated in Column (7), and Column (8) shows the \nresults of the paid claim development technique. The estimate of total unpaid claims is equal to \nthe sum of case outstanding and estimated IBNR. We present the total unpaid claim estimate in \nColumns (9) and (10) based on the reported and paid claim development techniques, respectively. \n \n \nReporting and Payment Patterns \n \nActuaries describe the reporting pattern of claims as the percentage of ultimate claims that are \nreported in each year. We can derive implied reporting patterns from the cumulative reported \nclaim development factors.44 The following table shows the cumulative reported claim \ndevelopment factors and the associated reporting pattern for U.S. Industry Auto. \n \nTable 3 \u2013 Reporting Pattern \n \nAge \n(Months) \nCumulative  \nReported Claim  \nDevelopment Factors \n \nCumulative % \nReported \n \nIncremental % \nReported \n12 1.292 77.4% 77.4% \n24 1.110 90.1% 12.7% \n36 1.051 95.1% 5.0% \n48 1.023 97.8% 2.7% \n60 1.011 98.9% 1.1% \n72 1.006 99.4% 0.5% \n84 1.003 99.7% 0.3% \n96 1.001 99.9% 0.2% \n108 1.000 100.0% 0.1% \n120 1.000 100.0% 0.0% \n \nThe percentage reported is equal to the inverse of the cumulative claim development factor.
