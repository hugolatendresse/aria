In his \n1973 paper \u201cUnallocated Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves in an Inflationary Economic \nEnvironment,\u201d96 John Kittel notes that the classical technique does include an inflation \nadjustment to the degree that total unpaid claims take inflation into account. If the costs \nunderlying ULAE inflate at the same rate as claim costs, then inflation is accounted for. However, \nif different rates of inflation underlie the claims experience and ULAE, the estimated unpaid \nULAE may not be predictive of future experience.  \n \nMango and Allen expand on this point: \n \n\u2026 the paid-to-paid ratio is distorted in an upward direction under inflationary \nconditions. This distortion arises because the impact of inflation on the \ndenominator of the ratio lags its impact on the numerator. This lag is due to the \nfact that most of the losses paid in a calendar year were incurred in a prior year, \nand thus are largely unaffected by the most recent inflation.97 \n \nIn summary, the classical technique may not be appropriate for every situation.
