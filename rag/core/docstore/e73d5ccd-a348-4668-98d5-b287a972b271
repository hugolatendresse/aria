Recall that private passenger collision is a very fast reporting and settling coverage of \nautomobile insurance. In our example, the reported claim counts at six months include many open \nclaims with case outstanding values. However, as time passes and these claims mature, many will \nclose without any payment. Due to the fast-reporting nature of this coverage, for a particular \naccident half-year, there are more claim counts closed without payment in subsequent valuations \nthan new claim counts reported. Thus, we see age-to-age factors of less than 1.00 for every \naccident half-year at 6-to-12 months. Similar behavior is evident through 36 months for the \nreported claim count triangle of age-to-age factors. \n \n                                                 \n61 We present this example using data at six-month evaluations for two reasons. First, to demonstrate to the \nreader that the estimation of unpaid claims is often conducted using data at valuations other than 12-month \nintervals. Second, this example demonstrates the potential influence of seasonality on claim development \nfactors. \n196", "type": "Document"}}
