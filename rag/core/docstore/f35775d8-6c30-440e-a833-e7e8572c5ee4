It is imperative that the \nrate classification system be in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in \nwhich a company is writing business.   \nFor example, some states have statutes prohibiting the use of gender in rating insurance while others \npermit it as a rating variable.  As a result, an insurer writing in multiple states may include gender as a \nrating variable in those states where it is permitted, but not include it in a state that prohibits its use for \nrating.  Some states may allow the use of a rating variable, but may place restrictions on its use.  For \nexample, some states allow credit score to be used for rating personal insurance for new business, but do \nnot allow insurers to raise the rates for renewal risks should the insured\u2019s credit worsen (although they \nmay allow companies to reduce rates if the insured\u2019s credit score improves).  Some states also prohibit \ncertain variables from use in the rating algorithm but allow their use in underwriting.  Underwriting \nvariables may be used to guide risk selection decisions, but could also guide risk placement decisions.32  \n                                                      \n30Usage-based insurance programs rely on on-board diagnostic devices to track various criteria about how the car is \nbeing driven (e.g., mileage by time of day and rapid changes in speed).  The insurer adjusts the next policy term \npremium based on the usage information reported automatically in the prior term. \n31 The issue is one of self-selection.  The only insureds who volunteer for the usage-based programs are those who \nbenefit from it in the way of lower rates.  Thus, the data cannot really be used to differentiate the high- and low-risk \ndrivers. \n32 In some cases, placing a risk into a different company or tier may affect the rate (though the criteria are not \nconsidered \u201crating variables\u201d by regulators).", "type": "Document"}}
