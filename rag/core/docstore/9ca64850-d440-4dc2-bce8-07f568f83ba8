Historical premium should also be adjusted for actual or expected distributional \nchanges.  This is referred to as premium trend.  One-step and two-step trending are discussed in detail in \nthis section. \nCurrent\tRate\tLevel\t\nTo illustrate the need for a current rate level adjustment, consider the simple scenario in which all policies \nwere written at a rate of $200 during the historical period.  After the historical period, there was a 5% rate \nincrease so the current rate in effect is $210.  Assume the \u201ctrue\u201d indicated rate for the future ratemaking \ntime period is $220.  If the practitioner fails to consider the 5% increase already implemented and \ncompares the historical rate (i.e., $200) to the indicated rate (i.e., $220), the practitioner will conclude that \nrates need to be increased by 10%.  Implementing this indicated rate change will result in a new rate of \n$231 (= $210 x 1.10), which is excessive.  If instead, the practitioner restates the historical premium to \nthe present rate level of $210 and compares that to the indicated rate, the practitioner will correctly \ndeduce that rates only need to be increased 4.8% (= $220 / 210 - 1.00).   \nThis section discusses two methods for adjusting premium to the current rate level:  extension of \nexposures and the parallelogram method.   \nSimple\tExample\t\nBefore describing the two methods for adjusting premium to current rate level, the details underlying a \nsimple rate change example will be summarized and later used to illustrate the mechanics of each method. \nIn this simple example, assume that all policies have annual terms and premium is calculated according to \nthe following rating algorithm: \nFee.Policy Factor ClassExposureper  RateExposure  Premium \uf02b\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  \nThe class factor has three values, or levels (X, Y, and Z), each with a distinct rate differential.   \nThe following three rate changes occurred during or after the historical experience period.", "type": "Document"}}
