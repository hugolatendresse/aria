Therefore, we conclude that both Berquist-Sherman \nadjustments are appropriate for XYZ Insurer. For this example, we prepare three separate \nprojections: \n \n\uf0be Adjustment due to changes in case outstanding adequacy only \n\uf0be Adjustment for changes in settlement rate only \n\uf0be Adjustments for both the change in case outstanding adequacy and settlement rates \n \nThe first step of the adjustment for changes in case outstanding adequacy is the determination of \nthe severity trend rate. In Exhibit III, Sheet 1, we analyze the average paid claims (using \nunadjusted data). We perform exponential regression analyses at each maturity age. Based on this \nanalysis and our knowledge of the insurance industry\u2019s experience for this line of business, we \nselect a 5% severity trend rate for XYZ Insurer. We do not observe any significant differences in \nthe trend rate by maturity age for ages 24 through 72 months; thus, we use the 5% severity trend \nrate for all maturities. \n \nIn the top part of Exhibit III, Sheet 2, we present the adjusted average case outstanding triangle. \nWe use the latest diagonal as the starting point and the selected 5% severity trend rate to develop \nthis triangle. In the bottom part of Exhibit III, Sheet 2, we summarize the adjusted reported claim \ndevelopment triangle. Adjusted reported claims are equal to the adjusted average case outstanding \ntriangle multiplied by the number of open claims and then added to the paid claims for each \naccident year-maturity age cell. We follow this approach for ages 12 months through 84 months.  \n \nFor the most mature ages (i.e., ages 96 months through 132 months), we judgmentally assume \nthat the unadjusted reported claim triangle is appropriate without any adjustment, although the", "type": "Document"}}
