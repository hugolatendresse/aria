In other words, if the company is targeting an average premium of $250 and \nusing a premium transition rule that is expected to span two years, then the company needs to \ndecide whether the base rate should be set so that average premium will equal $250 over the two \nyears combined or at the end of the two-year period.  If the cap applies equally to premium \nincreases and decreases, and the rate changes are uniformly distributed, this is not an issue.  \nHowever, that is not normally the case.    \nExpected\tDistribution\t\nWhether using extension of exposures or the approximated average rate differential methods to derive \nbase rates, the actuary makes an assumption about the distribution expected during the period the rates \nwill be in effect.  Normally, actuaries use the latest in-force distribution as the best estimate of the \nexpected future distribution.  If the company intends to non-renew certain policies, this distribution can be \nadjusted accordingly. \nBy using the latest in-force distribution to measure the proposed average premium or the proposed \naverage rate differential across all rating variables, the actuary assumes the rate change will not alter the \nexisting portfolio.  The validity of that assumption may vary significantly based on the product, market \nconditions, and the extent of the proposed changes.  For example, a small change that applies uniformly to \nall homeowners insureds will probably have very little impact on the overall distribution.  In this case, the \nactual average premium change will be close to that estimated using the latest in-force distribution.  On \nthe other hand, a non-standard auto insurer implementing a significant rate change that varies widely by \nage of insured may see a significant change in the overall volume and distribution of business (i.e., \ninsureds receiving large rate changes may non-renew their policies).
