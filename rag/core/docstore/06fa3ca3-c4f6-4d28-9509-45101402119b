Thus, in Columns \n(5) through (7) of Exhibit IV, Sheet 1, we adjust historical earned premiums to the 2008 rate \nlevel. We divide the trended claim counts by the on-level earned premium to determine frequency \nrates at the 2008 level. We select a 2008 frequency of 2.36%. To determine the 2007 frequency, \nwe adjust the selected frequency for 2008 (2.36%) by the annual claim count trend (-1.5%) and \nthe rate level change that took place in 2008 (20%). Thus, the 2007 frequency is 1.92%. \n \nIn Exhibit IV, Sheet 2, we adjust the projected ultimate severities from Exhibit II, Sheet 6 by \ntrend factors to reflect the accident year 2008 cost level. For this example, we assume a 5% \nannual severity trend. We also include an adjustment for the regulatory reforms that took place in \nrecent years. After a review of various averages and the adjusted severity indications by year in \nColumn (5), we select a 2008 severity value of $26,720. We derive the 2007 severity value of \n$25,448 by adjusting the selected 2008 for one less year of trend. \n \nIn Exhibit IV, Sheet 3, we derive projections of ultimate claims for 2007 and 2008 based on the \nearned premium provided by XYZ Insurer and the selected frequency and severity values derived \n204", "type": "Document"}}
