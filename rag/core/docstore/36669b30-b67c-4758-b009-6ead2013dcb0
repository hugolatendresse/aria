Recall from Chapter 6 that loss trends have a \nleveraged effect on increased limits losses.  More specifically, assuming a constant positive percentage \ntrend in total losses, the following relationship holds: \nTrend. Limits IncreasedTrend Limits Total Trend Limits Basic \uf0a3\uf0a3  \nSee Table 6.15 in Chapter 6 for a numeric example that demonstrates this relationship. \nAlso, depending on how recent the empirical data is, the claims may not be settled.  Since larger claims \noften develop differently than smaller claims, this can have an impact on the calculation of the increased \nlimit factors.  Ideally, all claims should be developed to ultimate before the application of these \ntechniques. \nIn addition to censoring through policy limits, losses may also be truncated from below if there is a \ndeductible applied to the policy.  While it is possible to \u201cadd back\u201d the amount of dollars eliminated due \nto the deductible on known claims, it may not be possible to know how many claims were completely \neliminated due to the deductible.   \nFitted\tData\tApproach", "type": "Document"}}
