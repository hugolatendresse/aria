The first thing we notice \nwhen comparing the top and bottom sections of Exhibit III, Sheet 10, is the differences between \nreported and paid claims in Columns (3) and (4). We can also see similar differences in the claim \ndevelopment triangles. The claim development triangles in Exhibit III, Sheets 4 and 5 (increasing \nclaim ratio scenario) are the same as the triangles in Exhibit III, Sheets 2 and 3 (steady-state) for \naccident years 1999 through 2003. However, beginning in accident year 2004, the reported and \npaid claims for all remaining years are higher for the increasing claim ratio scenario than the \nsteady-state scenario. This is consistent with our assumption of increasing claim ratios for \naccident years 2004 through 2008.  \n \n100", "type": "Document"}}
