Many insurers \ndo not have this ability. In these situations, actuaries may be limited to development triangles of \nreported and paid claims only. Actuaries are then faced with the challenge of finding other \nsources of data and information to ensure that they have sufficient knowledge of the insurer in \norder to determine the unpaid claims.  \n \nIn \u201cLoss Reserving,\u201d Mr. Wiser states: \u201cExploring the data begins by understanding the trends \nand changes affecting the database. Understanding the data is a prerequisite to estimating sound \nloss reserves. This exploration will help the analyst select appropriate loss reserving methods and \ninterpret the results of the methods.\u201d32   \n \nThe goal of this chapter is to demonstrate that the development triangle is an excellent tool for \nexploring the data. We discuss how important it is for the actuary to take the information obtained \nduring meetings with management and then seek confirmation in the actual claims experience. \nThe actuary should not simply accept reports of change or reports of no change without \nconfirmation. Without some form of verification, management\u2019s assertion of changes in the \nstrength of case outstanding or changes in the rate of claims settlement could lead to inaccurate \nestimates of unpaid claims by the actuary.  \n                                                 \n32 Foundations of Casualty Actuarial Science, 2001. \n76", "type": "Document"}}
