A claims-made policy should always cost less than an occurrence policy as long as claim costs \nare increasing. \n2. If there is a sudden, unpredictable change in the underlying trends, the claims-made policy priced \nbased on the prior trend will be closer to the correct price than an occurrence policy based on the \nprior trend. \n3. If there is a sudden, unexpected shift in the reporting pattern, the cost of a mature claims-made \npolicy (i.e., a policy that covers claims reported during the policy period regardless of accident \ndate) will be affected relatively little, if at all, relative to the occurrence policy. \n4. Claims-made policies incur no liability for IBNR, so the risk of reserve inadequacy is greatly \nreduced. \n5. The investment income earned from claims-made policies is substantially less than under \noccurrence policies. \nTo help illustrate these principles, assume the following: \n\uf0b7 Exposure levels are constant. \n\uf0b7 The average loss cost for Report Year 2010 is $1,000. \n\uf0b7 Loss costs increase by 5% each report year.   \n\uf0b7 An equal number of incurred claims are reported each year and all claims are reported within five \nyears of occurrence (i.e., 20% reported each year). \n\uf0b7 Loss costs do not vary by report year lag.  Also, any trends affecting settlement lag have been \nignored. \nThe assumptions are simple to help illustrate the principles.  Relaxing the assumptions does not change \nthe conclusions; it merely makes the interpretation more difficult. \n16.2 Comp arison of 2010 Claims-M ad e and  Occurrence Policies\n01234\n2010 L(2010,0) L(2010,1) L(2010,2) L(2010,3) L(2010,4)", "type": "Document"}}
