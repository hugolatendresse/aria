Statistical assumptions and model diagnostics will \nbe discussed in more detail later in this chapter. \nA fourth benefit of multivariate methods is that they allow consideration of the interaction, or \ninterdependency, between two or more rating variables.  Interactions occur when the effect of one \nvariable varies according to the levels of another (e.g., the effect of square footage varies across different \nlevels of amount of insurance).  Interactions are an important refinement to multivariate models that can \nimprove the predictive value.  They also complicate the model and should therefore be analyzed with an \neye for business considerations (e.g., ease of understanding and monitoring results). \nAs a side note, it is important not to confuse interaction (sometimes referred to as response correlation) \nwith exposure correlation, which describes a relationship between the exposures of one rating variable \nand another.  Gender exposures may be uniformly distributed across age (meaning at any age there is an \nidentical distribution of men and women and no exposure correlation exists), but the two variables may \ninteract if the loss experience for men relative to women  is distinctly different at the youthful ages than at \nthe middle and senior ages.  Conversely, a variable\u2019s exposures may be unevenly distributed across the \nlevels of another rating variable (i.e., exposure correlation exists), yet no interaction is present.  The other \nscenarios of both exposure correlation and interaction being present or neither being present are less \nconfusing. \nOther potential benefits vary considerably among the different types of multivariate methods.  For \nexample, GLMs, which will be discussed later in this chapter, are widely accepted as a classification", "type": "Document"}}
