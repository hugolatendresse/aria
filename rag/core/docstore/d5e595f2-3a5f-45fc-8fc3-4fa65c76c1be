The circumstances \nunderlying the specific data grouping (including the nature of the line of business, the credibility \nof the available claims data, and changes in the insurer\u2019s environment) should dictate the number \nof experience periods to include in the various averages. Similar to many actuarial decisions, \nthere is often a trade-off between stability, which is represented by a greater number of \nexperience periods included in the average values, and responsiveness, where only the most \nrecent experience periods are considered. \n \n \nStep 4 \u2013 Select Claim Development Factors \n \nThe selected age-to-age factor (also referred to as the selected claim development factor or \nselected loss development factor) represents the growth anticipated in the subsequent \ndevelopment interval. When selecting claim development factors, actuaries examine the historical \nclaim development data, the age-to-age factors, and the various averages of the age-to-age \nfactors. It is also common practice to review the prior year\u2019s selection of claim development \nfactors.39 \n                                                 \n39 A comparison to prior factors is important for several reasons. First, the actuary is able to compare his or \nher expectations at the prior valuation for development in the interval with actual experience. Second, an \nactuary is often balancing the conflicting goals of stability and responsiveness. By having the prior selected \nfactors as a reference point, the actuary can consider the extent to which he or she wants to change selected \nclaim development factors. Finally, it is valuable information to understand the effect of changes in \ndevelopment factors alone (or methodology) on the projected ultimate claims versus the effect of changes \nin the actual claim experience. \n87", "type": "Document"}}
