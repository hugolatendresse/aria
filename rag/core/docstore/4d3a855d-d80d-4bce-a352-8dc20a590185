An exposure is the basic unit that measures a policy\u2019s exposure to loss.  It is logical, therefore, \nthat the exposure serves as the basis for the calculation of premium.  Base rates, as discussed in Chapter 2, \nare typically expressed as a rate per exposure.  The premium is calculated as the base rate multiplied by \nthe number of exposures and adjusted by the effect of rating variables and sometimes other fees.   \nThis chapter covers: \n\uf0b7 Criteria that should be considered when selecting an exposure base \n\uf0b7 Special treatment of exposure for large commercial risks  \n\uf0b7 Methods of aggregating exposures (calendar year and policy year) and defining exposures \n(written, earned, unearned, and in-force) \n\uf0b7 Brief discussion on measuring trends in inflation-sensitive exposure bases. \nCRITERIA\tFOR\tEXPOSURE\tBASES\t\nA good exposure base should meet the following three criteria:  it should be directly proportional to \nexpected loss, it should be practical, and it should consider any preexisting exposure base established \nwithin the industry.   \nProportional\tto\tExpected\tLoss\t\nThe exposure base chosen should be directly proportional to expected loss.  In other words, all else being \nequal, the expected loss of a policy with two exposures should be twice the expected loss of a similar \npolicy with one exposure.  However, this does not mean that the exposure base is the only item by which \nlosses may systematically vary.  In general, expected loss will vary by a substantial number of factors and \nthese other factors should be used as rating or underwriting variables to further reflect these risk level \ndifferences.  The factor with the most direct relationship to the losses should be selected as the exposure \nbase.  This also makes the exposure base more easily understood by the insured.", "type": "Document"}}
