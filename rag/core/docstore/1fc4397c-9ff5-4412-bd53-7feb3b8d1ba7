By the time the policy year is complete (24 months after the beginning of \nthe policy year for annual policies), the policy year earned and written exposures are equivalent.  Unlike \ncalendar year earned exposure, exposure for one policy cannot be earned in two different policy years.  \nThe following table shows the policy year earned exposures for policy years 2010 through 2012 as of \nDecember 31, 2012.  \n \nThe assumption of an even earning pattern does not hold true for lines such as warranty and those affected \nby seasonal fluctuations in writings (e.g., boat owners insurance).  As such, actuaries analyzing these lines \noften specify other earning pattern assumptions based on historical experience. \nUnearned exposures represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has not yet been \nprovided as of that point in time.  This applies to individual policies as well as groups of policies.
