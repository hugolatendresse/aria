In contrast, the result of the pure \npremium formula is an indicated rate.  Because of this difference, the pure premium method must be used \nwith a new line of business for which there are no current rates to adjust.   \nSome actuaries prefer to express rate need in terms of a percent change to existing rates.  This percent \nchange approximates the average impact on existing policyholders if the fully indicated rates are \nimplemented (ignoring any changes in policyholder retention).  Consequently, the loss ratio method may \nbe preferred to the pure premium method in this case.  If the pure premium approach is used, however, the \nindicated change is easily calculated by comparing the indicated rate to the current rate.  \nEquivalency\tof\tMethods\t\t\nSince both formulae can be derived from the fundamental insurance equation, it should be understood that \nthe two approaches are mathematically equivalent.  To illustrate the point more clearly, the following \nshows the reconciliation of the two approaches. \nStart with the loss ratio indication formula: \n \n\uf028\uf029\n\uf05b\uf05d T\nC\nL\n01 Factor   Change  Indicated QV.\nFP\nEL\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d .     \nThis formula can be restated as follows:", "type": "Document"}}
