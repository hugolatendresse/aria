The neural network user gathers test data and invokes training algorithms designed to \nautomatically learn the structure of the data.  This technique has been described as a recursion applied to a \nGLM.   \nIn practice, the results of a neural network can be fed into a GLM (or vice versa).  This process helps \nhighlight areas of improvement in the GLM (e.g., a missing interaction). \nIn general the data mining techniques listed above can enhance a ratemaking exercise by: \n\uf0b7 whittling down a long list of potential explanatory variables to a more manageable list for use \nwithin a GLM; \n\uf0b7 providing guidance in how to categorize discrete variables; \n\uf0b7 reducing the dimension of multi-level discrete variables (i.e., condensing 100 levels, many of \nwhich have few or no claims, into 20 homogenous levels); \n\uf0b7 identifying candidates for interaction variables within GLMs by detecting patterns of inter-\ndependency between variables. \n \n A full survey of these and other methods is beyond the scope of this text.  For more information, readers \ncan reference \u201cThe Elements of Statistical Learning:  Data Mining, Inference and Prediction\u201d (Hastie et \nal. 2009). \nAUGMENTING\tMULTIVARIATE\tANALYSIS\tWITH\tEXTERNAL\tDATA\t\nThe adoption of GLMs also resulted in many companies seeking external data sources to augment what \nhad already been collected and analyzed about their own policies.  This includes but is not limited to \ninformation about: \n\uf0b7 geo-demographics (e.g., population density of an area, average length of home ownership of an \narea); \n\uf0b7 weather (e.g., average rainfall or number of days below freezing of a given area); \n\uf0b7 property characteristics (e.g., square footage of a home or business, quality of the responding fire \ndepartment); \n\uf0b7 information about insured individuals or business (e.g., credit information, occupation).", "type": "Document"}}
