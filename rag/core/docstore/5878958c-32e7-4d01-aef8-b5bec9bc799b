Unlike manufacturers, insurers may \nnot know the true cost of goods sold during a financial reporting period until several years later. \nAn insurer sells its promise to pay the policyholder or an injured party on behalf of the \npolicyholder in the event of an occurrence covered by the insurance policy. For some insured \nevents, the insurer is able to quantify the exact costs of settlement quickly and with great \nprecision. For other insured events, the insurer may not know the ultimate cost for years, and \npossibly decades. Nevertheless, the insurer must report its financial results on a regular basis. \nClaim reserves (also known as technical provisions in some parts of the world) represent the \ninsurer\u2019s estimate of its current liabilities for claims that occurred on or prior to the financial \nstatement reporting date but that have not yet been paid. Actuaries around the world work with \ninsurers and self-insurers to quantify, evaluate, and monitor estimates of unpaid claims. \n \nWe can look at the importance of accurately estimating unpaid claims from three viewpoints: \n \n\uf0be Internal management  \n\uf0be Investors \n\uf0be Regulators \n \n \nInternal Management \n \nFrom an internal management perspective, accuracy in the estimation of unpaid claims is \nessential for proper decision-making in virtually every area of an insurance company\u2019s operations \nincluding, but not limited to, pricing, underwriting, strategic, and financial decisions. An accurate \nestimate of unpaid claims is particularly important in pricing insurance products as inaccurate \nestimates could threaten the financial condition of an insurer. For example, an inadequate \nestimate of unpaid claims could drive an insurer to reduce its rates not realizing that the estimated", "type": "Document"}}
