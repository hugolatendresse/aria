Those comments apply to classification ratemaking as well. \nThe basic pure premium approach compares the expected pure premiums for each of the levels within a \nrating variable to determine the indicated relativity.  Given a rating variable R1 with the rate differential \nfor each level i given by R1i, then the rate applicable to each level of rating variable R1 (Ratei) is \ndetermined as the product of the base rate (B) and the rate differential (R1i): \n.1Rate BR ii \uf0b4\uf03d     \nUsing the subscript I to denote indicated, the indicated differential is calculated as follows: \n.

By \ndoing so, the actuary will \u201cflatten\u201d the otherwise indicated relativities to account for the fact that the fixed \nexpenses represent a smaller portion of the risks with higher average premium.   \nMaking the assumption that the fixed component is not necessary and substituting the formula for the \nindicated rate and base rate, the indicated differential for level i is calculated as follows: \n\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf05b\uf05d\n\uf05b\uf05d\n\uf05b\uf05d\n.\n01\n011\nT\n L\nT\nL\nI\n B\nB\n i\n i\n,i\nQV.\nEL\nQV.\nEL\nR\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf03d", "type": "Document"}}
