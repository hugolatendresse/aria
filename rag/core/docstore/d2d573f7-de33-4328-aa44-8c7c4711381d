During the experience period, this jurisdiction \nimplemented major tort reform aimed at modifying the liability covered by the insurance product. \nThe result of the tort reform was a change in the insurance product as well as a change in the \ninsurer\u2019s market presence. \n \nBefore we even begin with the calculations, we need to examine whether or not the development \ntechnique is appropriate for XYZ Insurer. Again, the underlying premise of the development \nmethod is that future claims activity can be projected based on historical claims experience. A \nprimary assumption of the reported claim development method is that there have been no \nsignificant changes in the adequacy of case outstanding over the experience period, and a primary \nassumption of the paid claim development method is that there have been no significant changes \nin the rate of settlement over the experience period. These methods also assume that the type of \nclaim has not changed during the period and the claim reporting lags (i.e., the time between date \nof occurrence and date of report) have not changed.  \n \nBased on the information we gathered through meetings with management of XYZ Insurer and \nthrough our actuarial diagnostic review, we question whether the development technique is in fact \nappropriate. We know that there have been changes in the case outstanding adequacy as well as \nchanges in the rate at which claims are closed. We also know that there have been changes in the \nclaim environment due to the tort reform. Therefore, the underlying assumptions do not hold true, \nand we must conclude that some type of adjustment for these changes is necessary for the \ndevelopment technique to be appropriate for XYZ Insurer. \n \n97", "type": "Document"}}
