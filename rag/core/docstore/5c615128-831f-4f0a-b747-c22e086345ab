Once individual risk conversion and \nretention rates are estimated, models and assumptions can be used to estimate future expected loss costs, \npremium, and expenses on these risks.  This allows calculation of expected profitability after the rate \nchange.  This information aids in business forecasting. \nDepending on the jurisdiction, regulators may require considerable detail about the methods and \nassumptions underlying the overall rate level and rate differential indications and selections.  Moreover, \nthey too may want to understand the expected policyholder dislocation.     \nIn addition to communicating the effect of the rate change, it is important for the ratemaking actuary to \nestablish a strategy to monitor the actual effect of the rate change against the expected effect.  This may \ninvolve comparing actual and expected close rates, retention rates, distributions, and claim frequencies \nagainst those expected.  The comparison allows quick identification of any strong differences, and allows \nthe company to investigate the potential source of any differences and act accordingly. \nSUMMARY\t\nPreceding chapters explained how to calculate actuarial indications and discussed reasons that companies \nmay implement something other than what was indicated.  If the actuarial analysis indicates that a product \nhas an inadequate rate level, the company can respond with non-pricing solutions (e.g., reduce expected \nexpenses or expected losses) or it can implement a rate change.  Much of this chapter focused on rate \nchange solutions, and in particular derivation of the base rate.  Two approaches for derivation of the base \nrate were outlined:  extension of exposures and an approximation of the average rate differential across all \nrating variables.", "type": "Document"}}
