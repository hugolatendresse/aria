It is called direct compensation because, even though someone else \ncaused the damage, the insured person collects directly from his or her insurer instead of from \nthe person who caused the accident. \n \n\uf0be General liability in the U.S. and Canada covers a wide array of insurance products. The \nprincipal exposures covered by general liability insurance are: premises liability, operations \nliability, products liability, completed operations liability, and professional (i.e., errors and \nomissions) liability. \n \n\uf0be Medical malpractice is also known as medical professional liability insurance. This coverage \nis often further separated into hospital professional and physician/surgeon professional \nliability insurance. Medical malpractice coverage responds to the unique general liability \nexposures present for insureds (both individuals and organizations) offering medical care and \nrelated professional services. We use an example from a pivotal paper, \u201cLoss Reserve \nAdequacy Testing: A Comprehensive, Systematic Approach\u201d by James R. Berquist and \nRichard E. Sherman.8 While the data for the medical malpractice example is obviously very \ndated, the methodology, approach, and conclusions remain applicable today. \n \n\uf0be Personal automobile insurance is also known as private passenger automobile insurance. \nAutomobile insurance (either personal or commercial) can provide a variety of coverages, \nincluding first-party and third-party coverages; the available coverages are dependent upon \nthe jurisdiction in which the insurance is written. \n \n\uf0be Primary insurance refers to the first layer of insurance coverage. Primary insurance pays \ncompensation in the event of claims arising out of an insured event ahead (first) of any other", "type": "Document"}}
