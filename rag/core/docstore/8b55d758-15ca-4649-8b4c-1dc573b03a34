Often these territories were developed by a third-party (e.g., ISO or \nNCCI) using industry data.  Over time, companies began to subdivide (or modify) the territories to try to \ngain a competitive advantage.  In many cases, the refinement was based on operational knowledge of the \narea and judgment.  Recently, actuaries are applying more advanced methods such as geo-spatial \ntechniques to develop or refine territorial boundaries.  Actuaries are also using both internal and external \ndata in their analyses.", "type": "Document"}}
