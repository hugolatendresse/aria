(Tail factors are described in greater detail \nin the next section.) We use actuarial judgment to select these factors after reviewing all of the \nage-to-age factors, the various averages, and the prior year\u2019s selected factors. In the exhibits, we \nuse the label \u201cTo Ult\u201d (i.e., To Ultimate) to designate the tail factor; in the following tables, we \nlabel the tail factors \u201c120-Ultimate\u201d (i.e., 120 months-to-ultimate). Both labels are commonly \nused by actuaries to indicate the selected tail development factor.  \n \nWe recognize that the selections of development factors are subjective and will likely differ from \none actuary to another, perhaps materially, as the selection process involves significant actuarial \njudgment. When different actuaries apply their own experience and insight to the analysis of the \nsame data, the selected age-to-age factors typically differ \u2013 sometimes by a small amount and \nsometimes by a large amount. It is important to appreciate that there is more than one reasonable \nselection of age-to-age and tail factors.  \n \nTable 1, which is an excerpt from Exhibit I, Sheets 1 and 2, summarizes the selected reported and \npaid claim development factors by age-to-age interval for U.S. Industry Auto. \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Selected Age-to-Age Factors \n  \n12-24 \n \n24-36 \n \n36-48 \n \n48-60 \n \n60-72 \n \n72-84 \n \n84-96 \n96-\n108 \n108-\n120 \n120-\nultimate \nReported 1.164 1.056 1.027 1.012 1.005 1.003 1.002 1.001 1.000 1.000 \nPaid 1.702 1.186 1.091 1.044 1.019 1.009 1.005 1.002 1.002 1.002 \n \n \nStep 5 \u2013 Select Tail Factor \n \nEarlier in this book we introduced the topic of the number of development periods needed for the \nanalysis of unpaid claims.
