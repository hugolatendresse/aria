This is the losses paid on the second claim through December 31, \n2011 ($5,000 + $8,000 + $1,000), plus the case reserve estimate for this claim as of December 31, 2011 \n($0). \nThe Policy Year 2009 reported losses as of December 31, 2011, are $25,000, which considers transactions \nfrom both of these policies.  This is the sum of the losses paid on both policies ($1,000 + $7,000 + $3,000 \n+ $5,000 + $8,000 + $1,000), plus the case reserve estimate as of December 31, 2011 ($0). \nThe Policy Year 2010 reported losses as of December 31, 2011, are $0 since neither of these policies was \nissued in 2010. \nTable 6.2 summarizes Calendar Year 2009, Accident Year 2009, and Policy Year 2009 reported losses at \nthree different valuation points.  \n6.2 Rep orted  Losses: CY 09 v  AY 09 v  PY 09\nAggregation Type 12/31/2009 12/31/2010 12/31/2011\nCalendar Year 09 $10,000 $10,000 $10,000\nAccident Y ear 09 $10,000 $10,500 $11,000\nPolicy Year 09 $10,000 $27,500 $25,000\nValuation Date\n \nThe chart demonstrates that while the calendar year reported losses are finalized at the end of the year, \naccident year and policy year losses are not.  In particular, policy year losses undergo significant \ndevelopment during the second twelve months of the 24-month policy year period.  This longer lag time \nrequired to get accurate policy year estimates is considered a shortcoming of the policy year aggregation \nmethod.  \nThe Report Year 2009 reported losses only include amounts associated with the first claim as it was \nreported in 2009.  As of December 31, 2009, the Report Year 2009 reported losses are $10,000, which \nreflects the outstanding case reserve only as the paid losses at December 31, 2009, are $0.
