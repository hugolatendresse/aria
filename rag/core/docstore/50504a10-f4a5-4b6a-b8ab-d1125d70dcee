If the historical data to which selected loss trends will be applied is restated to \nreflect the new benefit level, then either data adjusted for benefit level should be used for the trend \nanalysis, or the trend analysis must remove the impact of the benefit level change.  The pricing actuary \nmust take care not to \u201cdouble count\u201d the benefit level change in the projected losses. \nThe ratemaking actuary should use judgment in deciding whether the historical data is overly volatile or \notherwise inappropriate for trending purposes.  For example, the data may be too sparse or reflect non-\nrecurring events that cannot be appropriately adjusted.  Alternatively, the statistical goodness of fit of the \ntrending procedure may be called into question.  One option is to supplement the loss trend data with \nmulti-state, countrywide, or industry trend data and consider weighting the results.  Alternatively, the \nactuary may consider non-insurance indices, if available.  For example, the medical component of the CPI \n(Consumer Price Index) may be relevant when selecting severity trends for insurance products related to \nmedical expense coverage.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes average weekly wage \nchanges by state, which can be useful when selecting trends for U.S. workers compensation indemnity \nlosses.  \n                                                      \n22 If catastrophe claims are paid in the first quarter of 2011, then they will affect the 12-month calendar year loss \ntrend data for the 12 months ending the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011.  If the catastrophe claims are \npaid out over several quarters, then it will extend the impact even further.", "type": "Document"}}
