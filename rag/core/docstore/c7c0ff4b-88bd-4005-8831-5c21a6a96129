Therefore it does not allow for the particular allocation of ULAE costs between \nopening, maintaining, and closing claims which may vary from insurer to insurer. Finally, the \nissue related to the potential for different rates of inflation between ULAE and claims remains in \nthe Kittel refinement.  \n \n \nConger and Nolibos Method \u2013 Generalized Kittel Approach \n \nIn developing their generalized approach as part of a specific client assignment, Conger and \nNolibos sought to define a procedure to estimate unpaid ULAE that would: \n \n\uf0b7 Recognize an insurer\u2019s rapid growth \n \n\uf0b7 Be consistent with patterns of the insurer\u2019s ULAE expenditures over the life of a claim \n \n\uf0b7 Reproduce key concepts underlying the Johnson technique \n \n\uf0b7 Use commonly available and reliable aggregate payment and unpaid claims data \n \n\uf0b7 Include an extension to the Kittel refinement which would allow for alternatives to the \ntraditional 50/50 rule \n \nThe generalized approach employs the concept of weighted claims, which recognizes that claims \nuse up different amounts of ULAE at different stages of their life cycle, from opening to closing. \nNewly opened, open, and newly closed claims are each given different weights when determining \nthe claims basis to which ULAE payments during a past or future calendar period are related. \nSince Conger and Nolibos believe that handling costlier claims warrants and requires relatively \nmore resources than handling smaller claims, they use claim dollars instead of claim counts in \ntheir generalized approach. \n \nThe claim basis for a particular time period is defined to be the weighted average of the:", "type": "Document"}}
