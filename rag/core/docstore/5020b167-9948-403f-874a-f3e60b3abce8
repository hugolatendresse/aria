Some insurers may establish case outstanding for ALAE (or DCC) only and other \ninsurers for ULAE (or A&O) only.  \n \nThere are also different practices for the establishment of case outstanding for salvage and \nsubrogation recoveries. Some insurers set up specific case outstanding based on an estimate of the \nsalvage or subrogation recovery that the insurer expects to receive (i.e., the case outstanding is net \nof expected salvage and subrogation recoveries). Many insurers, however, simply track the actual \nsalvage and subrogation recoveries but do not establish case outstanding for these types of \nrecoveries. \n \nFor many insurers, determining the case outstanding for reinsurance recoveries is a fairly straight-\nforward exercise. When the reinsurance is proportional (i.e., quota share), insurers determine the \nceded case outstanding based on the reinsurer\u2019s share of the total case outstanding. If the \nreinsurance is excess of loss, the reinsurance ceded case outstanding for a claim that exceeds the \ninsurer\u2019s retention is simply the total case outstanding estimate (provided that the claims adjuster \nestimates the case outstanding on a total limits basis) less the insurer\u2019s retention.  \n \n \nThe Life of a Claim \n \nOne single insurance claim may have a life that extends over a number of years. We will use the \nexample of an automobile insurer who issued a policy effective for a one-year term beginning on \nDecember 1, 2007 and ending on November 30, 2008.
