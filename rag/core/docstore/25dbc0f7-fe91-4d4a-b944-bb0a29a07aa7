The \nselection of variables for input to this model may require the opinions of an expert panel of \ndoctors, lawyers, and other practitioners from around the world. The complex stochastic model \nmay also require detailed analyses of the frequency rate of claims and the likely cost of each \nclaim if it were to occur. \n \nIn this chapter, we focus only on exposure-based methods for determining expected claims. For \nfurther information, we refer students to the CAS Research Working Party on Bornhuetter-\nFerguson Initial Expected Losses. The goal of this working party is to produce a paper addressing \nthe topic of expected losses (i.e., expected claims). \n \nIn many respects, an exposure-based method of determining expected claims consists of very \nbasic calculations. Actuaries calculate expected claims by multiplying a predetermined exposure \nbase by a selected measure of claims per unit of exposure (known as the pure premium or the loss \nrate). The unpaid claim estimate is simply the projected expected claims less paid claims.  \n \nThe two challenges of the expected claims method are to determine the appropriate exposure base \nand to estimate the measurement of claims relative to that exposure base. \n \nFor commercial insurers (and reinsurers), the most common exposure base is earned premium and \nthe most common measurement of claims is the claim ratio. Expected claims are then equal to the \nproduct of the earned premium and the expected claim ratio.  \n \nSelf-insured organizations do not generally collect premiums in the same way that an insurer \ndoes. As a result, actuaries working with self-insurers generally use other exposure bases that \nthey believe are closely related to the risk and thus the potential for claims and are readily", "type": "Document"}}
