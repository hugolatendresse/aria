Since medical \nmalpractice tends to be a line of business where partial payments are not common, the paid claim \ntriangle can be used with the closed claim counts triangle to approximate the average paid claims \non closed counts. At the bottom of Exhibit I, Sheet 5, we reproduce the average paid claims on \nclosed count triangle from the Berquist-Sherman paper.  \n \nWhen we compare the annual rates of change between average case outstanding and average paid \nclaims, we observe very different trend indications. The annual trend rate appears to be \napproximately 30% based on a review of the average case outstanding triangle; however, using \nthe average paid claim triangle, the annual trend rate indications range from approximately 7% to \n14%. Berquist and Sherman note that the observed trends for average paid claims are similar to \nindustry benchmarks (at the time), and thus they conclude that the higher trends for average case \noutstanding are indicative of changes in case outstanding adequacy. \n \n \nMechanics of the Berquist-Sherman Case Outstanding Adjustment  \n \nThe mechanics of the Berquist-Sherman adjustment for changes in case outstanding adequacy are \nfairly straightforward. There are, however, two decisions requiring judgment by the actuary. First, \nthe actuary must choose a diagonal from which he or she will calculate all other values of the \nadjusted average case outstanding triangle. For this purpose, the most prevalent choice tends to be \nthe latest diagonal of the average case outstanding triangle. An advantage of selecting these \naverage case outstanding values is that the latest diagonal of the adjusted reported claim triangle", "type": "Document"}}
