Similar \nto Approach #2, we rely on the projected ultimate claim counts derived from the reported claim \ncount experience. In Exhibit VI, Sheet 1, we select disposal rates based on the simple average of \nthe latest two years. We see evidence of change in the disposal rates for the latest valuations, \nparticularly at 12, 24 and 36 months. In Exhibit VI, Sheet 2, we complete the square of projected \nincremental claim counts. The next step is to determine the incremental paid severities; we show \nthis process in Exhibit VI, Sheet 3. \n \nIn Exhibit VI, Sheet 4, we select severity values at the 2008 cost level (after adjustment for trend \nand tort reform) by maturity age. We assume 5% severity trend for XYZ Insurer. Similar to the \nprior example for GL Insurer, we observe increasing severity values for each successive maturity \nage.
