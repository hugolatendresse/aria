Not all actuaries start by gathering data, then meeting with management, and \nend with conducting an actuarial diagnostic review of the data. Generally the information gathering \nis an ongoing process with much back-and-forth dialogue between the actuary and management.  \n \nFor actuaries responsible for estimating unpaid claims who work as employees of an insurer, the \ninformation gathering process will likely be continual and ongoing. Conversations with colleagues \nin various departments (such as claims, underwriting, reinsurance, and systems) may take place on \na routine basis. These conversations may be formal through regular monthly or quarterly meetings, \nor informal and unscheduled. For actuaries who work as independent consultants, the \ncommunication with the insurer\u2019s employees in various departments tends to be less frequent. Often \nthe consultant will schedule formal meetings at least once a year to review the departments\u2019 key \nactivities that can have a significant influence on the estimation of unpaid claims. \n \nThere is no one right or wrong approach for the actuary to collect data and information. What is \ncritically important, however, is that the process includes both a review of quantitative data and \ndiscussions with key members of the insurer\u2019s claim and underwriting departments. Both of these \ncomponents will assist the actuary in selecting the appropriate techniques for estimating unpaid \nclaims. Discussions with management will help the actuary understand anomalies in the data. The \nreview of the data will help direct the actuary to ask management specific questions concerning issues \nthat manifest themselves in the data. Such questions will help the actuary gain a better understanding", "type": "Document"}}
