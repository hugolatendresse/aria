In this \nexample, the link ratios for each development period are fairly consistent across the accident years and \nthe all-year arithmetic average link ratios are selected.  \nIn practice, age-to-age development factors may not be as stable as in the example outlined above and \ntherefore simply averaging all of the historical link ratios may not be appropriate.  First, if the ratemaking \nactuary believes the patterns may be changing over time, the actuary may prefer to rely on more recent \ndevelopment patterns rather than the average over a long period of time.  In such cases, the actuary may \nselect a two- or three-year average.  Second, in some cases the actuary may want to make selections based \non the most recent data, but the line of business may be too volatile to rely solely on a two- or three-year \naverage.  The actuary may calculate weighted average link ratios giving more weight to the more recent \nyears.  Third, development factors may vary widely between accident years or there may be a strong \nanomaly in one or two accident years.  The actuary may consider adjusted averages that eliminate the \nhighest and lowest development factors from the calculation.  In general, the actuary should make loss", "type": "Document"}}
