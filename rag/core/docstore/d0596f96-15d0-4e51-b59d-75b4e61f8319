Similarly, we use the terms \u201creported claim \ncounts\u201d and \u201cclosed claim counts\u201d to refer to cumulative reported and closed claim counts, \nrespectively. For some examples in Chapters 11 through 13, we use incremental values of claims \nand claim counts. Any development triangles containing incremental values, of claims or claim \ncounts, are specifically labeled as incremental.  \n                                                 \n27 As noted on the previous page, cumulative paid claims on closed claim counts may be difficult to obtain. \nIn such cases, actuaries may determine that interim or pre-closing payments are immaterial enough to \njustify the inexact match from including all payments, even those from open claims, divided by closed \nclaim counts. \n62", "type": "Document"}}
