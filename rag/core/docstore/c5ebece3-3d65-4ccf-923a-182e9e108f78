The pure premium approach does not \nconsider exposure correlations with other rating variables.  If the rating algorithm only contained a \nhandful of rating variables, this shortcoming could be mitigated with two-way analysis or some manual \nadjustments.  Today, however, actuaries working on many lines of business are analyzing tens or \nhundreds of variables that make manual adjustment inefficient if not impossible.   \nAs an illustrative example of the distortion created with univariate methods, a one-way pure premium \nanalysis may show for a personal auto insurance book of business that older cars have high claims \nexperience relative to newer cars.  In reality, however, this analysis is distorted by the fact that older cars \ntend to be driven by younger drivers\u2014who tend to have high claims experience.  The experience for both \nyoung drivers and old cars looks unfavorable despite the fact that this may be driven primarily by the \nyouthful driver effect.", "type": "Document"}}
