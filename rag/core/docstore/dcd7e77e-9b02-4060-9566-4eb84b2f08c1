First, it is important for the actuary to have a clear understanding of the \ndefinition of closed and reported claim counts. Some insurers include claims with no payment \n(CNP) in the definition of closed claim counts and other insurers exclude CNP. Similarly, some \ninsurers include claims with no case outstanding and no payments in the definition of reported \nclaim counts, and other insurers define reported claim counts as only those claims with a case \noutstanding greater than $1 or with a claim payment. The result of including CNPs in closed \nclaim count statistics or claims with no case outstanding or payments in reported claim counts is a \nmuch lower average value. For the actuary, what is most important is that he or she knows what \ndefinition the insurer uses and that the insurer is consistently using the same definition throughout \nthe experience period. A change in the definition of claim counts can have a significant \nconsequence on the results of diagnostic analyses using claim counts and on estimation \ntechniques that rely on the number of claims. It is also important that the actuary is aware of \ndifferences between the insurer\u2019s definition of claim counts and any external benchmarks that \nwould be used for comparison purposes.  \n \nSecond, large claims, both the presence and absence of such claims, can have a distorting effect \non average claims. Actuaries may remove unusually large claims from the database before \nconducting both ratio and average value calculations and handle the unpaid claim estimate \nrequired for such large claims separately. Another alternative is to prepare development triangles \nusing limited claims. For example, claims can be limited to $500,000 or $1 million per", "type": "Document"}}
