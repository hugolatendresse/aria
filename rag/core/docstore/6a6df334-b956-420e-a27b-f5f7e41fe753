The Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique is essentially a blend of the \ndevelopment and expected claims techniques. In the development technique, we multiply actual \nclaims by a cumulative claim development factor. This technique can lead to erratic, unreliable \nprojections when the cumulative development factor is large because a relatively small swing in \nreported claims or the reporting of an unusually large claim could result in a very large swing in \nprojected ultimate claims. In the expected claims technique, the unpaid claim estimate is equal to \nthe difference between a predetermined estimate of expected claims and the actual payments. \nThis has the advantage of stability, but it completely ignores actual results as reported. The \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique combines the two techniques by splitting ultimate claims into \ntwo components: actual reported (or paid) claims and expected unreported (or unpaid) claims. As \nexperience matures, more weight is given to the actual claims and the expected claims become \ngradually less important. \n \nIn the 1993 paper \u201cLoss Development Using Credibility,\u201d53 Eric Brosius described the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method as a credibility weighting between the development method and \nthe expected claims method. In the development method, full credibility (i.e., Z = 1) is given to \nactual claims experience; and in the expected claims method, no credibility (i.e., Z = 0) is given \nto actual claims. In the Bornhuetter-Ferguson, credibility is equal to the percentage of claims \ndeveloped at a particular stage of maturity, which is a function of the cumulative claim \ndevelopment factor (i.e., Z = 1.00 / cumulative development factor). Therefore, more weight is", "type": "Document"}}
