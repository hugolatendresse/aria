Actuaries employ a variety of ratemaking techniques depending on specific \ncircumstances.  For example, techniques used to price short-tailed lines of insurance (e.g., personal \nautomobile) are different than techniques used in long-tailed lines (e.g., workers compensation).  Even \nwithin the same insurance product, actuarial techniques may differ due to regulatory requirements and \ndata limitations.  Furthermore, actuarial techniques are constantly evolving due to enhanced information \nand advances in technology. \nThis text is not intended to document every technique used for P&C insurance ratemaking.  Instead, the \npurpose of this text is to provide an overview of basic ratemaking techniques used in the industry.  As \nsuch, actuaries should continue to increase the depth and breadth of their knowledge to be able to discern \nthe most appropriate technique for a given situation. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\t\nThe completion of this text required significant effort from many individuals other than the primary \nauthors.  The authors want to acknowledge the following individuals for researching and summarizing \nexisting ratemaking material, offering alternative ratemaking techniques, and reviewing countless drafts:   \nCatherine Taylor, FCAS, MAAA and her CAS committee, comprised of Nancy Braithwaite, \nFCAS, MAAA; Ginda Fisher, FCAS, MAAA; Chris Styrsky, FCAS, MAAA; Jane Taylor, \nFCAS, MAAA; Theresa Turnacioglu, FCAS, MAAA; and Ron Zaleski, Jr., FCAS, MAAA, \ndedicated to partnering with EMB to facilitate the successful completion of this text.  \nThe following associates of EMB:  Tom Hettinger, ACAS, MAAA; David Sommer, FCAS; \nEmily Stoll, ACAS, MAAA; Julie Walker, ACAS, MAAA; Sandy Wu, ACAS, MAAA; Harsha \nMaddipati; and Peter Quackenbush. \nThe following actuaries who were consulted for their expertise in specific ratemaking topics:", "type": "Document"}}
