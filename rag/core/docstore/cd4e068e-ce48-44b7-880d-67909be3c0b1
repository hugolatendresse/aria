The \nactuarial estimate and the complement can take many forms, as demonstrated in the appendices.  The \nactuarial estimate in Appendix A is the indicated rate change from the subject experience.  It is credibility \nweighted with the trended present rates indicated rate change.  Appendix B credibility weights the \nstatewide ex-catastrophe pure premium with a regional ex-catastrophe pure premium.  The actuarial \nestimate in Appendix C is the indicated rate change from the subject experience.  It is credibility-\nweighted with the countrywide indicated rate change.  Appendix E, a univariate classification analysis, \ncredibility weights the indicated pure premium relativities with the current pure premium relativities.  \nBefore blending these two sets of relativities, each is normalized such that the weighted average relativity \nis 1.00. \nCREDIBILITY\tWHEN\tUSING\tSTATISTICAL\tMETHODS\t\nWhen performing a multivariate classification analysis using statistical techniques such as generalized \nlinear models (as discussed in Chapter 10), statistical diagnostics provided with the model results are used \nto gauge to what extent the model results are meaningful given the data provided.  Examples of statistical \ndiagnostics include standard errors of the parameter estimates and standardized deviance tests (e.g., Chi-\nSquare or F-test), as well as practical tests such as consistency of model results over time.  The modeler \nconsiders this information when selecting the final model structure and the final rate \ndifferentials.  Statistical methods also provide diagnostics that inform the modeler of the overall \nappropriateness of the model assumptions (e.g., the link function or error term selected).  Examples of \nsuch diagnostics include deviance residual plots and leverage plots.", "type": "Document"}}
