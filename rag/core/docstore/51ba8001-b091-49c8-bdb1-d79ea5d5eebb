A quick look at the higher volume of earned premiums for these two \nyears provides some of the explanation for the increase. However, we observe that, at the 12-\nmonth valuation, reported claims are again increasing at a rate that is greater than the increase \nin exposures and our knowledge of the inflationary environment. For example, we compare \nreported claims between accident years 2004 and 2005:  \n \n [ ( A Y 2005 / AY2004) \u2013 1.00] = [($28,674 / $16,995) \u2013 1.00] = 69%  \n \nThe 69% increase observed in reported claims between 2004 and 2005 is greater than the \nincrease in exposures between these years, which is 21%. Similarly, we compare reported \nclaims between accident years 2004 and 2006: \n \n[(AY2006 / AY2004) \u2013 1.00] = [($27,066 / $16,995) \u2013 1.00] = 59%  \n \nThe 59% increase observed in reported claims between 2004 and 2006 is greater than the \nchange in exposures between these years, which is actually a decrease of 14%. \n \n\uf0be If we look down the 24-month column, we observe unusually large volumes of reported \nclaims for accident years 2004 through 2006. For each of these years, reported claims are \ngreater than $40 million, and the on-level reported claim ratios are greater than 0.40. For \nthese same three accident years, we see that XYZ experienced larger volumes of paid claims \nwith values of approximately $10 million for 2004 and $12 million for 2005 and 2006. We \nalso note that, at 24 months, accident year 2007 reported claims are lower than the preceding \nthree accident years. Could the lower claims in 2007 be a result of the tort reforms introduced \nduring 2006? \n \n\uf0be When we analyze the experience for accident year 2006, we should keep in mind that the \ninsurer experienced a significant reduction in exposures during the year.
