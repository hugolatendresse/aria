For example, if a company \nimplements a new loss control program, the expectation is that the expected losses will be lower than that \nindicated by the actual historical experience; consequently, an underwriter can use schedule rating to \nreflect this. \nSchedule rating is typically applied in the form of percentage credits (reductions) and debits (increases) to \nthe manual rate.  The characteristics can be objective (e.g., the number of years a physician has been \nlicensed) or subjective (e.g., quality of company management).  Objective characteristics are generally \neasier to quantify and validate.  However, schedule rating often requires significant underwriting \njudgment.  In general, state insurance laws and regulations require that the filed schedule rating guidelines \nare applied consistently, and documentation is often required to support the application of each credit and \ndebit. \nIf experience rating is used in addition to schedule rating, then it is important to recognize that a new \ncharacteristic (e.g., a newly implemented safety program) reflected in the schedule rating adjustment will \neventually be reflected in the loss experience.
