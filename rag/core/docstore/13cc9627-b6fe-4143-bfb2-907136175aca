We determine the appropriate cumulative claim \ndevelopment factor based on the age of each accident year; we then multiply each accident year\u2019s \nreported (and paid) claims at the latest valuation by its age-to-ultimate factor (i.e., cumulative \nclaim development factor).  \n \nDetailed calculations are presented in Exhibit I, Sheet 3. The first column of Exhibit I, Sheet 3, is \nthe accident year. Our example for U.S. Industry Auto includes accident years 1998 through \n2007. In the second column, we show the age of each accident year as of the latest valuation of \nclaims (i.e., December 31, 2007). Columns (3) and (4) summarize reported and paid claims, \nrespectively, by accident year at December 31, 2007. Column (3) is the last diagonal of the \nreported claim development triangle in Exhibit I, Sheet 1, and Column (4) is the last diagonal of \nthe paid claim development triangle in Exhibit I, Sheet 2. Columns (5) and (6) are the cumulative \nclaim development factors that are calculated in Step 5. Each cumulative claim development \nfactor refers to a specific age.  \n \nProjected ultimate claims based on the reported claim development method are equal to the latest \nvaluation of reported claims multiplied by the cumulative reported claim development factors. \n(See Column (7) of Exhibit I, Sheet 3.) For example, projected ultimate claims for accident year \n1998 are calculated as follows: \n \n P r o j e c t e d  u l t i m a t e  c l a i m s  f o r  a c c i d e n t  y e a r  1 9 9 8  \n =  ( r e p o r t e d  c l a i m s  f o r  1 9 9 8  a s  o f  1 2 /31/07) x (reported CDF at 120 months) \n =  $ 4 7 , 7 4 2 , 3 0 4  x  1 . 0 0 0  \n =  $ 4 7 , 7 4 2 , 3 0 4  \n \nAnd for accident year 2007, \n \n P r o j e c t e d  u l t i m a t e  c l a i m s  f o r  a c c i d e n t  y e a r  2 0 0 7  \n =  ( r e p o r t e d  c l a i m s  f o r  2 0 0 7  a s  o f  1 2 /31/07) x (reported CDF at 12 months)", "type": "Document"}}
