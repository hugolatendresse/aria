These estimates may be based on external \ndata or determined judgmentally. \nLOSS\tRATIO\tMETHOD\t\t\nThe loss ratio method is the more widely used of the two rate level indication approaches.  This approach \ncompares the estimated percentage of each premium dollar needed to cover future losses, loss adjustment \nexpenses, and other fixed expenses to the amount of each premium dollar that is available to pay for such \ncosts.  In other words, this method compares the sum of the projected loss and LAE ratio and the \nprojected fixed expense ratio to the variable permissible loss ratio.  That relationship can be written as \nfollows: \n\uf05b\uf05d\n\uf05b\uf05d .%Profit  Target UW %  Expense Variable1.0\nRatio  Expense FixedRatio LAE&Loss Factor  Change  Indicated \uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf03d    \nTo the extent that the numerator and denominator are not in-balance, the indicated change factor will be \nsomething other than 1.0.  The resulting factor can be applied to the current premium to bring the formula \nback in balance.   \nUsing the same notation, the loss ratio indication formula can be rewritten as follows: \n\uf028\uf029\n\uf05b\uf05d .QV.\nFP\nEL\nT\nC\nL\n01 Factor   Change  Indicated \uf02d\uf02d\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\n \nThis is commonly rewritten as an indicated change by subtracting 1.0: \n\uf028\uf029\n\uf05b\uf05d 1.0.01  Change  Indicated\nT\nC\nL\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d QV.\nFP\nEL\n  \nDerivation\tof\tLoss\tRatio\tIndicated\tRate\tChange\tFormula\t\t\nTo better understand the loss ratio indicated rate change formula, it is helpful to demonstrate the \nrelationship between the formula and the fundamental insurance equation.
