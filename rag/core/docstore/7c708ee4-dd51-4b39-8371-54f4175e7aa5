When considering homogeneity, it is important to differentiate \nbetween expected and actual costs.  Even truly identical risks may have different loss experience during a \ngiven policy period due to the random nature of the insurance events (i.e., even the highest-risk drivers \nwill not necessarily have a claim every policy period and the lowest-risk driver may have a claim).  The \nkey for classification analysis is to identify and group risks for which the magnitude and variability of \nexpected costs are similar; by doing so, the actuary will develop more accurate and equitable rates. \nFinally, the number of risks in each group should either be large enough or stable enough or both for the \nactuary to be able to accurately estimate the costs.  Actuaries refer to this as having sufficient credibility \nand this will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12.  If a particular level of a rating variable includes \ntoo few risks or is not stable over time, then the experience may lack the credibility necessary to \n                                                      \n28 The factors can be tested using the techniques described later in this and the following chapters.", "type": "Document"}}
