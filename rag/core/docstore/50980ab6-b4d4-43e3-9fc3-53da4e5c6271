The actuary must \nunderstand whether or not the data include or exclude: IBNR, estimates of unpaid claim \nadjustment expenses, recoverables from salvage and/or subrogation, reinsurance recoveries, and \npolicyholder deductibles.  \n \n \nClaims, Losses, and Claim Counts \n \nThe terms claims and losses are used interchangeably in this text.

The \nterm claims is also more frequently used for financial reporting purposes of insurers.
