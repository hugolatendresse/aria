Another alternative is for \nthe actuary to use a weighted average based on assigned weights to the various methods; these \nweights may be consistent for all years or may vary by accident year. The important point is that \nthere is no single \u201cright\u201d way for the actuary to select ultimate claims (and thus the unpaid claim \nestimate). The actuary must take into consideration the results of the various techniques, \ndiagnostic tests including implied claim ratios and severities, and all the information gained \nduring the process of estimating unpaid claims. As stated earlier in this chapter, to the extent \nsufficient data is available, retroactive tests may also prove valuable to the actuary when selecting \nwhich methods to rely on for selecting ultimate claims. \n \nFor our example, we select ultimate claims based on: the Berquist-Sherman adjusted reported \nclaim for accident years 1998 through 2004; the average of the adjusted reported and paid \nBornhuetter-Ferguson techniques for accident years 2005 and 2006; the adjusted reported \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique for accident year 2007; and the average of the adjusted reported \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique and frequency-severity approach #2 for accident year 2008. The \nkey drivers in our selections by accident year are the estimated IBNR, the estimated ultimate \nseverities, and the estimated claim ratios. Later in this chapter, we will return to these selected \nultimate claims when we present an example for monitoring the unpaid claim estimate on a \nquarterly basis. \n348", "type": "Document"}}
