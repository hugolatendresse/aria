This is referred to as composite rating for loss-rated risks, and is the focus of this section of \nthe chapter.  Specifically, this section will focus on ISO\u2019s Composite Rating Plan for Loss-Rated Risks.  \nIt should be noted that some rules specific to ISO\u2019s plan have been simplified or omitted because they are \nbeyond the scope of this paper.    \nExample\tComposite\tRating\tPlan\tfor\tLoss\u2010Rated\tRisks\t\nIn ISO\u2019s Composite Rating Plan, an insured is eligible for being classified as \u201closs-rated\u201d if its historical \nreported losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses over a defined period exceed a specified aggregate \ndollar amount.  The threshold varies based on different combinations of coverage and limits.  If eligible, \nthe insured\u2019s historical experience is implicitly considered 100% credible for purposes of determining the \ncomposite rate. \nThe process for determining the composite rate for a loss-rated risk is summarized below.   \nFor each type of coverage and for each of the past five completed years of experience, the reported loss \nand ALAE based on the most recent valuation is developed to ultimate and trended to the average \naccident date of the proposed policy period: \n  T r e n d e d  U l t i m a t e  L o s s  &  A L A E  b y  c o v e r a g e  b y  y e a r  =   \n  ( R e p o r t e d  L o s s  &  A L A E )  x  ( D e v e l o p m e n t  F a c t o r )  x  ( L o s s  &  A L A E  T r e n d  F a c t o r ) .  \nAfter the insured selects a composite exposure base to use for rating, the composite exposures for the past \nfive years are measured and, if applicable, trended from the average earned date of the historical policy to \nthe average earned date of the future policy period.  It should be noted that the application of a trend \ndepends on the composite exposure base that is selected.  Sales and payroll are common commercial lines", "type": "Document"}}
