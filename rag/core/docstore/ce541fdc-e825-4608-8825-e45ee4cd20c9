Johnson, like Brian, then projects the future number of \nnewly reported claims, as well as the number of claims that will be in a pending status each year \u2013 \nand thus will require maintenance work during the year. Also like Brian, Johnson estimates the \ncost of each transaction by comparing historical aggregate ULAE expenditures to the number of \ntransactions occurring in the same time period. \n \nThe Johnson technique allows for an explicit differential in the amount of ULAE resource or \ncost required for different types of claim transactions. She provides a specific medical \nmalpractice example in which, based on qualitative input, the process of opening a claim costs \n$x and the process of maintaining existing claims costs an additional $x. \n \n                                                 \n106 CAS Discussion Paper Program, May 1988. \n403", "type": "Document"}}
