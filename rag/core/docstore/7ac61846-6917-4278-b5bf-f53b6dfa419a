Today, this is generally done judgmentally.  Perhaps in the future, \nactivity-based cost studies will more accurately segregate expenses.  Sensitivity testing had revealed that \nthe overall indication is not materially impacted by moderate swings in the categorization of expenses. \nSecond, the method essentially allocates countrywide fixed expenses to each state based on the exposure \nor policy distribution by state (as it assumes fixed expenses do not vary by exposure or policy).  In reality, \n                                                      \n27 If the selected expense trend is based on historical internal expense data (e.g., historical changes in average \nexpense per exposure) rather than external indices, then the trend will implicitly include the impact of economies of \nscale in the past.  Assuming the impact of economies of scale will be the same as in the past, the projected average \nexpense per exposure should be consistent and no further adjustment is necessary.        \n7.6  Data Summization for E xp osure/Policy-Based  Projection M ethod\nExpe ns e Data Us e d Fi xe d Var i abl e\nGe n e ra l Co u n t ry wid e Ea rn e d  Exp o s u re Ea rn e d  Pre miu m\nOther Acquisition Countrywide Written Exposure Written Premium\nCommis s ions  and Brokerage Countrywide/State Written Expos ure Written Premium\nTax es, Licenses, and Fees State Written Exposure Written Premium\nDivided By", "type": "Document"}}
