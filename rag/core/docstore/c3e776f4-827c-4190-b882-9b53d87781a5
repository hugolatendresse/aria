The \nmarketing information may include: \n\uf0b7 Competitive comparisons \n\uf0b7 Close ratios, retention ratios, growth \n\uf0b7 Distributional analysis \n\uf0b7 Dislocation analysis \nCompetitive\tComparisons\t\nOne way for an insurer to study its competitive position is to compare its premium to the premium \ncharged by one or more competitors.  The availability and accuracy of competitor premium information \nvaries by jurisdiction and by product.  Even in the U.S. where companies are routinely required to file \nrating manuals, all the information necessary to accurately determine the premium charged by \ncompetitors can be difficult to obtain.  For example, U.S. commercial lines companies typically adjust the \nmanual rate via schedule and experience rating (which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 15).  In \nU.S. personal lines, estimating a competitor\u2019s premium can be difficult if the competitor makes extensive \nuse of risk placement to vary the rate charged.  For example, U.S. personal lines companies utilize \nunderwriting tiers that essentially function as an additional rating variable, but the guidelines or \nalgorithms that allocate risks into tiers are not always publicly available.   \nIn more sophisticated, less regulated markets (e.g., the U.K.), rate manuals may not be readily available, \nand rates may be changed as frequently as daily.  Companies in these markets may rely on obtaining \ncompetitive price information from brokers, questioning potential or existing customers about price \ninformation, or surveying Web-based quoting engines.", "type": "Document"}}
