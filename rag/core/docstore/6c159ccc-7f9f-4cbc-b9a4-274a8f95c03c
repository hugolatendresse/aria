Even after analysis clearly indicated that the risk varied significantly within the \nadult class (e.g., drivers over the age of 65 are relatively higher risk drivers than adult drivers under the \nage of 65), many companies did not immediately implement a more refined classification plan because \nthe change required significant systems changes.   \nIn addition, the implementation of a new rating variable may require data that has not been previously \ncaptured.  While it may be possible to obtain this data from a third-party vendor, it is often necessary to \nget this data directly, either through a questionnaire sent to insureds or by visually inspecting the insured \nitem.  These approaches can necessitate additional insurance company staff with unique skills.  For \nexample, new building techniques (e.g., tie-down roofs) have enabled homes to better withstand strong \nwinds.  Because companies were not previously offering lower rates for such features, the information \nwas not tracked by most companies.  As a result, trained inspectors were necessary to ascertain the \nexistence of these features.  If such inspectors are not readily available, implementation may not be \nfeasible immediately. \nWhen an operational constraint arises, a cost-benefit analysis can be performed to help determine the \nappropriate course of action.  Consider the example of a systems constraint that prohibits the introduction \nof a new or refined rating variable.  The cost of implementing the change is the tangible cost associated \nwith modifying the system.  The benefit of implementing the change is the incremental profit that can be \ngenerated by charging more accurate rates, and presumably attracting more appropriately priced", "type": "Document"}}
