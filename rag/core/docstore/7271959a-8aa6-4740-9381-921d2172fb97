The pure premium for each level is based on the experience of each \nlevel, and assumes a uniform distribution of exposures across all other rating variables.  To the extent that \none territory may have a disproportionate number of exposures of high or low amount of insurance \nhomes, this assumption is violated.  By ignoring this exposure correlation between territory and amount \nof insurance, the loss experience of high or low amount of insurance homes can distort the indicated \nterritorial relativities resulting in a \u201cdouble counting\u201d effect.    \nIn the simple example, the Territory 1 indicated pure premium relativity is higher than the true relativity \ndue to a disproportionate share of high-value homes in Territory 1.  Similarly, the Territory 3 indicated \npure premium relativity is lower than the true relativity due to a disproportionate share of low-value \nhomes in Territory 3.  If amount of insurance were distributed in the same way within each territory, the \nresulting indicated relativities from the pure premium method would not have been affected.  This does \nnot mean that each of the three amount of insurance levels needs to represent one-third of the exposures \nwithin each territory; it merely implies that the distribution of amount of insurance must be the same \nwithin every territory.   \nThis example only has two rating variables.  In reality, there are many different characteristics that affect \nthe risk potential for each insured.  To the extent there is a distributional bias in some or all of the other \ncharacteristics, the resulting pure premiums can be materially biased.  \nLoss\tRatio\tApproach\t\nThe major difference between the pure premium and loss ratio approaches is that the loss ratio approach \nuses premium as opposed to exposure.
