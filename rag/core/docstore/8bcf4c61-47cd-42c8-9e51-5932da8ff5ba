To \nincorporate this difference in the rates, insurers use expense adjustments and loss constants in the rating \nalgorithms. \nFor many property lines of business, such as homeowners, it is important that the property be insured to \nthe value assumed in the rates.  When insureds underinsure their properties, they risk not being fully \ncovered in the event of a loss; moreover, this condition creates inequity compared to policies that are \ninsured to full value.  Insurers address this inequity by either reducing covered losses through a \ncoinsurance clause or by adjusting rates according to the degree of underinsurance.  Insurers have also \nimplemented various initiatives to ensure that individual risks are insured to the appropriate value.", "type": "Document"}}
