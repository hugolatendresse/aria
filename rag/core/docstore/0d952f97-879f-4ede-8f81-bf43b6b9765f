This relativity is less subject to annual change than the dollar cost per transaction or \nper activity. With relativities, the actuary could then use the general approaches described in \nRahardjo and Mango-Allen, but now with some quantitative basis for the magnitude of the \nparameters. \n \n \nTriangle-Based Techniques \n \nActuaries can also estimate ULAE using triangle-based development techniques. A key \ndifference between triangle analysis of claims experience and ULAE experience is the method \nused to assign ULAE to individual cells (accident year by evaluation year) of the triangle. Since \n\u201cactual\u201d ULAE by accident year is not observable, at least not for all categories of ULAE, the \nactuary will need to formulate assumptions for the creation of the paid ULAE triangle. This \nallocation of ULAE payments is typically based on the pattern of claim payments, which can be \nobserved. It is important to recognize, however, that the accident year triangles of ULAE may be \ndistorted if either the method of allocating calendar ULAE to accident years changes over time or \nif the claims payment patterns change. \n \nIn the paper \u201cTesting of Loss Adjustment (Allocated) Expense Reserves,\u201d110 R.S. Slifka suggests \nusing a time-and-motion study to estimate the claim department\u2019s allocation of resources between \ncurrent accident year claims and prior accident year claims. This relationship between the \u201ccost\u201d \nof current year\u2019s claim management activities and prior years\u2019 claim management activities can \nbe used then to estimate the future payment activities. Assume for example that a time and \nmotion study suggests that: \n \n\uf0b7 60% of the current accident year\u2019s ULAE remains unpaid \n\uf0b7 15% of the prior accident year\u2019s ULAE remains unpaid \n\uf0b7 5% of the second prior accident year\u2019s ULAE remains unpaid \n \nThe total unpaid ULAE is estimated as 80% (60% + 15% + 5%) of a typical calendar year\u2019s", "type": "Document"}}
