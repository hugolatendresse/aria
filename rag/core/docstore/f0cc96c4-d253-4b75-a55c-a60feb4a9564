Claims 4 and 5 were \nalready in excess of $25,000, so the amount of loss under the limit is the same before and after the trend.   \nIn contrast to the basic limits, the magnitude of the positive trend on excess losses is greater than the total \nlimits trend.  Because Claims 1 and 2 are significantly below the limit, they do not exceed the limit even \nafter the 10% increase and do not impact the trend in the excess layer.  Claim 3 was below the limit prior \nto the application of trend, but pierced into the excess layer after the trend.  Claims 4 and 5 were already \nhigher than the limit; consequently, the entire increase in losses associated with these claims is realized in \nthe excess losses trend.  \nTable 6.21 highlights the differences in trend for each layer: \n6.21 Effect of Limits on Increasing Severity Trend \nInitial Loss Size Basic Limits Total Losses Excess Losses \nTrend 1.0\nLimitLoss \uf02b\uf03c  Trend Trend Undefined \nLimitLossTrend 1.0\nLimit \uf03c\uf0a3\uf02b\n 1.0Loss\nLimit \uf02d  Trend Undefined \nLossLimit \uf0a3  0% Trend \uf05b \uf05d\nLimit - Loss\nLimit-Trend)(1.0Loss \uf02b\uf0b4  \n \nIn the case of positive severity trend this means: \nTrend.
