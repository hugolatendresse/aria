In addition to adjusting the \nhistorical premium to the current rate level, the premium also must be adjusted to reflect any premium \ntrend.  To adjust for premium trend, the actuary needs to determine how to measure any changes that have \noccurred, decide whether observed distributional shifts were caused by a one-time event or a shift that is \nexpected to continue in the future, and judgmentally incorporate any additional shifts that are reasonably \nexpected to happen in the future. \nThe actuary may consider examining how premium distributions by individual rating variable have \nshifted over time.  However, this may not always be practical or conclusive.  Such distributional data may \nnot be readily available, or the actuary may find that several variables have experienced small premium \nshifts and the compound effect is difficult to quantify.  Consequently, the analysis usually focuses on \nmeasuring all premium shifts simultaneously. \nActuaries typically examine changes in historical average premium per exposure to determine an \nappropriate adjustment to account for premium trend.  Actuaries do not use changes in total premium \nbecause a company that is growing (or shrinking) will have increasing (or decreasing) total premium even", "type": "Document"}}
