Also, if the \nratemaking actuary chooses to incorporate underwriting expense provisions and target profit provisions \nthat vary by type of risk, the indicated pure premiums for each level can be adjusted by the applicable \nprovisions prior to calculating the indicated relativities.   \nDepending on the nature of the portfolio, it may not always be necessary to trend and develop the loss and \n(A)LAE.  In stable portfolios for many short-tailed lines of business (e.g., homeowners), it is often \nacceptable to ignore these adjustments for classification analysis.  If the portfolio is growing or shrinking, \nor the distribution of loss and (A)LAE by class is changing over time, a multi-year pure premium analysis \nwould be improved by applying aggregate trend and development factors to the individual year\u2019s loss and \n(A)LAE before summing.  In certain long-tailed lines (e.g., workers compensation), it is quite possible \nthat classes of risk undergo trend and development at materially different rates.  For example, workers \ncompensation risks with return-to-work programs may experience less development over time than risks \nwithout such a program.  If trend and development are believed to be materially different by level, the \nactuary may want to consider developing and/or trending individual risks or levels prior to classification \nanalysis.
