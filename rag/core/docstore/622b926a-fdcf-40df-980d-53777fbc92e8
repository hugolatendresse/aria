In our examples, we examine three specific trend rates: \nexposure trend, frequency trend, and severity trend.  \n \nWhen selecting trend rates, there are numerous considerations for the actuary. The selection of \nfrequency and severity trends often reflects not only economic inflationary factors but also \nsocietal factors that tend to increase both the number and the size of claims over time. Trend rates \ntypically vary by line of business and even by subcoverage within a line of business. In addition, \nthere can be significant variation in trend rates for exposures, frequency, and severity by \ngeographic region (e.g., country, state/province within a country, and even subdivisions within a \nstate/province). Severity and frequency trend rates can also vary based on the limits (i.e., \nretention) carried by the insurer or self-insurer. For U.S. workers compensation, it is often \nappropriate to incorporate adjustments for statutory benefit changes into the analysis as well as \ninflationary trend factors. \n \nThere are various sources actuaries turn to when selecting trend assumptions, including general", "type": "Document"}}
