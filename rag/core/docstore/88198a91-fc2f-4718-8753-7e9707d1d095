By grouping the data into accident years, each row consists of a fixed \ngroup of claims. In our example, the reported claim development triangle includes the reported \nclaims for accident years 2005 through 2008. The first row of the triangle represents claims \noccurring in 2005; the second row, claims occurring in 2006; the third row, claims occurring in \n2007; and the final row, claims occurring in 2008. \n \n52", "type": "Document"}}
