The actuary should use the available data to estimate the loss trends in an effort to project the \nhistorical losses into the future. \nLoss\tTrend\tSelections\t\nMonetary inflation, increasing medical costs, and advancements in safety technology are examples of \nfactors that can drive loss trends.  Social influences also impact loss costs.  Actuarial Standard of Practice \nNo. 13, Trending Procedures in Property/Casualty Insurance Ratemaking (Actuarial Standards Board of \nthe American Academy of Actuaries 2009) defines social influences as \u201cthe impact on insurance costs of \nsocietal changes such as changes in claim consciousness, court practices, and legal precedents, as well as \nin other non-economic factors.\u201d  Distributional changes in a book of business also affect frequencies and \nseverities.  If the proportion of risky policies is growing, loss costs will be expected to increase.   \nActuaries generally measure loss trend by fitting curves to historical data.  In addition to analyzing pure \npremium data, frequency and severity are typically analyzed separately to better understand the \nunderlying drivers of the trend.  For example, if an insurance company heavily markets a higher \ndeductible, the resulting shift in distribution will lower frequencies but is likely to increase severities.  It \nmay be difficult to detect these changes in a pure premium analysis. \nThe years chosen to be included in the historical data is based on the actuary\u2019s judgment, in consideration \nof both responsiveness and stability.  Though the aim of the analysis is to detect the true underlying trend, \ninfluences such as the cyclical nature of insurance and random noise may be difficult to eliminate from \nthe trend analysis.  The actuary should, however, adjust the trend data for more easily quantifiable effects \nsuch as seasonality and the effect of benefit level changes, which will be addressed later.", "type": "Document"}}
