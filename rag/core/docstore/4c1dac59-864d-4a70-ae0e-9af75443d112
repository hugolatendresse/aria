For both paid and reported severities, we select development factors based on \nthe medial average (i.e., average excluding high and low values) for the latest five years. We \nselect a tail factor at 96 months of 1.025 for the reported severities and 1.15 for the paid \nseverities. These selections are based on our analysis of insurance industry benchmark \ndevelopment patterns for U.S. workers compensation. \n \nIn Exhibit III, Sheet 8, we compare these two projections and select ultimate severities for accident \nyears 2001 through 2006. The next step is to adjust the severities for each historical accident year to \nthe cost level of accident year 2008. For simplicity purposes, we assume a 7.5% annual severity \ntrend rate for WC Self-Insurer. This self-insurer operates throughout the U.S., and for illustration \npurposes, we chose to simplify the model by not incorporating an adjustment of claims by year to \nthe 2008 statutory benefits level. Many actuaries would likely incorporate such an adjustment when \nselecting the 2008 severity value, particularly if the entity operated in a single state. In Exhibit III, \nSheet 9, we select a 2008 severity value of $7,100. We then derive the 2007 severity value of \n$6,605 by dividing the selected 2008 severity by the trend factor or 1.075. \n \n \n                                                 \n63 Potential factors that may cause a negative claim count trend for U.S. workers compensation include \nimprovements in workplace safety or changes in the mix of job types (e.g., a shift from less construction \nand manufacturing to lower risk \u201cwhite collar\u201d type of work). \n203", "type": "Document"}}
