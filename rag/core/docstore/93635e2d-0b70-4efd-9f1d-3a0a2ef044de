For example, the National Council on Compensations Insurance (NCCI) publishes estimated \nindustry effects of benefit level changes at the state level. \nMore detailed information on adjustments for benefit changes in workers compensation insurance can be \nfound in Sholom Feldblum\u2019s \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation Ratemaking\u201d (Feldblum 1993). \nLoss\tDevelopment\t\nThe cost for the insurance product, unlike other industries, is not fully known when the contract is \nprovided or even when a claim is first reported.  As a claim matures, payments are made and claim \nadjusters gather more information about the value of the loss until the final payment is made and the \nultimate amount is known.  For lines of business that settle claims quickly (\u201cshort-tailed lines,\u201d examples \nof which include automobile physical damage and homeowners) the ultimate amount is known rather \nquickly.  In contrast, for some long-tailed lines (e.g., commercial general liability, workers compensation, \nor personal umbrella) it may take many years for the ultimate amount to be known.   \nAs the ratemaking actuary typically uses the most recent accident year data available, the historical losses \nare to some degree immature and therefore the ultimate loss amount is not yet known.  This is more \npronounced if policy year data is used.  The process of adjusting immature losses to an estimated ultimate \nvalue is known as loss development.  Much of the vast library of property/casualty actuarial literature has \nbeen devoted to this topic.  Explaining and comparing all known methods is beyond the scope of this text, \nbut a cursory explanation of one commonly used method, the chain ladder method, is provided below.", "type": "Document"}}
