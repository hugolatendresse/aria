The disposal rate is equal to the cumulative closed \nclaim counts for each accident year-maturity age cell divided by the ultimate claim counts for the \nparticular accident year. Upon review of the disposal rates (top part of Exhibit II, Sheet 5), we see \nevidence of a decrease in the rate of claims settlement for Berq-Sher Auto BI Insurer. \n \nBerquist and Sherman select the claims disposal rate along the latest diagonal as the basis for \nadjusting the closed claim count triangle. An advantage of selecting the latest diagonal as the \nstarting point is that the latest diagonal of the adjusted paid claim triangle will not change from \nthe unadjusted paid claim triangle.  \n \nWe multiply the selected disposal rate for each maturity by the ultimate number of claims to \ndetermine the adjusted triangle of closed claim counts. For example, the adjusted closed claim \ncounts for accident year 1974 at 12 months of 3,37975 is equal to the selected disposal rate at 12 \nmonths of 0.433 multiplied by the projected ultimate claim counts for accident year 1974 of \n7,803. Similarly, the adjusted closed claim counts for accident year 1971 at 60 months of 9,71676 \nis equal to the selected disposal rate at 60 months of 0.977 multiplied by the projected ultimate \nclaim counts for accident year 1971 of 9,945. The last diagonal in the adjusted closed claim count \ntriangle in Exhibit II, Sheet 5 is the same as the unadjusted closed claim count triangle presented \n                                                 \n75 Note, slight differences which exist between values in the text and values in the exhibits are due to the \nfact that the exhibits carry a greater number of decimals than shown. \n \n76 Note, slight differences which exist between values in the text and values in the exhibits are due to the \nfact that the exhibits carry a greater number of decimals than shown. \n288", "type": "Document"}}
