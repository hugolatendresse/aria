In a report from the finance department, unpaid claims (or reserves) generally \nrefer to the estimate of total unpaid claims including both case outstanding and IBNR. For the \nclaims department, however, reports showing unpaid claims (or reserves) generally refer to case \noutstanding only. Some TPA reports use the term reserves in detailed claims listings to represent \nthe total reported value of the claims (i.e., cumulative payments plus current case outstanding \nestimates). In this situation, the actuary would need to subtract cumulative paid claims from the \nreserves in order to determine the value of unpaid case. The actuary also needs to understand if \nthe unpaid claim estimate is net or gross of deductibles or other types of recoveries, including \nsalvage, subrogation, and reinsurance recoveries, and where in the claims process those \nrecoveries are included. Finally, the actuary needs to know whether or not case outstanding \ninclude claim-related expenses. Some insurers record case outstanding and payments for claim-\nrelated expenses separately from claim only case outstanding and payments; other insurers record \nexpense payments separately (from claim payments) but do not carry case outstanding for \nexpense. \n \nAnother example of differences in the use of the term \u201creserves\u201d can be found in the actuarial and \naccounting professions in South Africa and the United Kingdom. It is typical for accountants in \nthese countries to distinguish between provisions (i.e., unpaid claim estimates) and reserves;  \nactuaries usually use the term \u201creserves\u201d to refer to the unpaid claim estimates and do not \ndistinguish between different types of reserves. \n \n                                                 \n17 In the U.S., the National Council on Compensation Insurance has Financial Data Calls that require \nincurred losses by accident year that include IBNR.
