The presentation \nand calculations are identical to the previous example for U.S. Industry Auto (Exhibit I). We will \nnot examine the results of this projection in detail because we know that the expected claims \nestimates underlying the projections are likely inaccurate. Remember that the primary assumption \nof the development method does not hold true for XYZ Insurer as a result of the operational and \nenvironmental changes that took place during the experience period. Nevertheless, we derive the \ncurrent estimates of expected claims using unadjusted reported and paid claim development \nmethods. We compare the results of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method with the expected claims \nmethod and the development method in Exhibit II, Sheet 3 (projected ultimate claims) and in \nExhibit II, Sheet 4 (estimated IBNR). In later chapters, we look at alternative methods that can be \nused for developing expected claims for use in a revised Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.  \n \n \nInfluence of a Changing Environment on the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method57 \n \nIn Chapters 7 and 8, we discuss the performance of the development technique and the expected \nclaims technique, respectively, during times of change. We continue with these examples using \nthe Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. Since the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a combination of \nthe development method and the expected claims method, we will refer you to these prior \nchapters for critical input. For example, refer to Chapter 7 for the reported and paid claim \ndevelopment triangles and the selection of age-to-age factors, and refer to Chapter 8 for the \ncalculation of expected claims. \n \n \nScenario 1 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Steady-State", "type": "Document"}}
