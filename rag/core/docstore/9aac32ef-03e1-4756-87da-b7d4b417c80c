Some research has been conducted around incorporating Bayesian \nanalysis into the statistical modeling process (for example, the use of hierarchical models), but this is \nbeyond the scope of this text. \nSUMMARY\t\nThe purpose of this chapter was to provide a broad overview of the credibility procedures used in \nratemaking.  As discussed, the credibility-weighted actuarial estimate is expressed by the following \nformula: \n .Experience  Related x ) - (1   Experience   Observed x    Estimate ZZ \uf02b\uf03d  \nThe classical credibility method and least squares credibility method prescribe different procedures for \ndeveloping the credibility measure, Z.  Classical credibility is effective in developing results that \nminimize the fluctuation from the related experience.  Least squares credibility is used to generate \naccurate rates.  In Bayesian analysis, there is no specific calculation of Z; it is based on the fundamental \nnotion that the prior estimate is adjusted to reflect the new information, which is introduced into the prior \nestimate in a probabilistic manner.  Once the method for developing the credibility measure is selected,", "type": "Document"}}
