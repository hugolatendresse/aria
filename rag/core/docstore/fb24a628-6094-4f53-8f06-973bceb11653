The actuary should select an appropriate annual loss trend, often consistent with the trend used in \nthe latest rate level indication, and apply it from the original target effective date of the current rates to the \ntarget effective date of the new rates.  The original target effective date of the current rates is used as the \n\u201ctrend from\u201d date rather than the actual effective date to account for the fact that changes are not always \nimplemented when planned and rates may remain in effect for shorter or longer than planned.  By using \nthe target effective date, the actuary is trending from the date assumed in the prior actuarial analysis. \nCombining these two adjustments, the complement of credibility (C) that is used to supplement the \nindicated rate is calculated as follows:    \n.ReviewLast  with dImplementeCost  Loss\nCost  Loss IndicatedPrior  Factor  Trend Loss  RatePresent  \uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03dC  \n \nBy way of example, assume the following: \n\uf0b7 Present average rate is $200. \n\uf0b7 The selected annual loss trend is 5%. \n\uf0b7 The rate change indicated in the last review was 10%, and the target effective date was January 1, \n2011. \n\uf0b7 The rate change implemented with the last review was 6%, and the actual effective date was \nFebruary 1, 2011. \n\uf0b7 The proposed effective date of the next rate change is January 1, 2013. \nBefore calculating the complement of credibility, the loss trend length must be measured.
