The second claim \nwas reported in 2010 and, therefore, only contributes to Report Year 2010 losses.    \nCOMMON\tRATIOS\tINVOLVING\tLOSS\tSTATISTICS\t\nFour common ratios involving loss statistics are:  frequency, severity, pure premium, and loss ratio.  As \nstated previously, each ratio is defined by a choice of relevant statistics (e.g., paid or reported losses, or \nearned or written premium), a data aggregation method (e.g., calendar, accident, policy, or report \nmonth/quarter/year), an accounting period, and a valuation date.   \nFrequency is a measure of claim incidence and is generally expressed per unit of exposure.  Consider a \nprivate passenger automobile example.  In a given calendar-accident year, an insurance company has \n150,000 earned car years.  As of six months after the close of the calendar year, it is known that 7,500 \nclaims occurred during the calendar-accident year.  The calendar-accident year reported claim frequency \nas of 18 months is 7,500 / 150,000 = 0.05.  The numerator of this ratio can be expressed in various ways", "type": "Document"}}
