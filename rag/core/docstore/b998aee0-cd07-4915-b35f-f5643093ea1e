Other methods are used under particular circumstances.  For example, the \nBerquist-Sherman method is often used when a company has experienced significant changes in claim \nsettlement patterns or adequacy of case reserves that would distort development patterns.  The method \nproduces adjusted development patterns that are estimated to be consistent with the reserve levels and \nsettlement rates present as of the last diagonal by restating historical development data.  Stochastic \nmethods, such as the Mack method, study the variability around loss development so actuaries can better \nunderstand the risk of adverse development.  These methods are covered in more detail in literature \nregarding loss reserving methodologies.   \nIn many insurance companies, different professionals may be responsible for estimating ultimate losses \nfor the purposes of ratemaking verses establishing adequate reserve levels.  Though the applications are \ndifferent, the goal of estimating ultimate losses is the same.  It is important that these professionals share \nknowledge of data, methods, and results in order to ensure consistent management of the company. \nLoss\tTrend\t\nIn addition to projecting historical losses to an ultimate level, it is necessary to adjust the losses for \nunderlying trends expected to occur between the historical experience period and the period for which the \nrates will be in effect.  Claim frequencies and claim costs are both impacted by underlying factors that \nmay change expected levels over time.  These changes in frequency and severity are referred to as loss \n                                                      \n21 This assumes the estimate of the extraordinary loss is reasonably accurate and will change less drastically (as a \npercentage) than the non-excess losses.
