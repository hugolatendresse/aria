Unpaid ULAE could be estimated by the following formula: \n \nUnpaid ULAE = M x (L / B \u2013 1.00) \n \nThey note that such an approach implies that unpaid ULAE are proportional to paid amounts \nreported to date. Aside from the practical difficulty of establishing the ULAE amounts paid that \ncorrespond to accidents occurring during a particular period, this method, similar to the paid \nclaims development method, may be overly responsive to random fluctuations in ULAE \nemergence. \n \n \nApplication of Generalized Approach to Claim Counts \n \nConger and Nolibos note that the generalized approach can also be used with claim counts or \ntransaction counts. The formula for a claim count basis used in the determination of unpaid \nULAE is:  \n \nb = (v1 x r) + (v2 x o) + (v3 x c), where \n \n\uf0b7 r represents reported claim counts \n\uf0b7 o represents open claim counts \n\uf0b7 c represents closed claim counts \n\uf0b7 v1 is the estimate of the relative cost of handling the reporting of a claim (for one \nyear) \n\uf0b7 v2 is the estimate of the relative cost of managing an open claim (for one year) \n\uf0b7 v3 is the estimate of the relative cost of closing a claim (for one year) \n \nAs in Johnson\u2019s paper, Conger and Nolibos suggest that is not necessary to determine the \nactual costs of the various claim activities but instead their relative magnitudes. For \nexample, Johnson assumes that v1 = 2, v2 = 1, and v3 = 0.  \n \nUsing estimated v1, v2, and v3, we can then select w* representing the ratio of ULAE to \nthe claim count basis based on the historical data w = M / b, where M still represents \nULAE payments. After selecting a value of w* (or a series of w*i which reflect future \ninflation adjustments), the unpaid ULAE can be estimated as: \n \nUnpaid ULAE = \u03a3 w*i x [(v1 x ri) + (v2 x oi) + (v3 x ci)], where", "type": "Document"}}
