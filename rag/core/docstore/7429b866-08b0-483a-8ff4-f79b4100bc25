The first issue is that the method \nassumes policies are written evenly throughout the year.  While that assumption may be reasonable for \nsome lines of business, it can be inappropriate for other lines.  For example, boat owners policies are \ngenerally purchased in the first half of the year prior to the start of boat season.  Thus, the distribution of \ninception dates for pleasure boat owners policies is generally not uniform throughout the year.  The \nparallelogram method can be performed using more refined periods of time than a year\u2014for example, \nquarters or months.  This alleviates the effect of uneven earnings to some degree.  Another technique to \nadjust for this is to calculate the actual distribution of writings and use these to determine more accurate \nweightings to calculate the historical average rate level.  To do this, the policies are aggregated based on \nwhich rate level was applicable rather than based on a standard time period (i.e., a month, year, or \nquarter).  The premium for each rate level group is adjusted together based on subsequent rate changes.   \nThe second issue with the parallelogram method is that it is generally applied at the aggregate level using \na series of overall average changes.  So, while the overall premium may be adjusted to an approximated \ncurrent rate level, the premium for certain classes will not be on-level if the implemented rate changes \nvaried by class.  Consequently, the adjusted premium will likely be unacceptable for any classification \nratemaking analysis.  This is a major shortcoming that has forced many companies to abandon this \napproach in favor of the extension of exposures approach.  This is especially true for lines with complex", "type": "Document"}}
