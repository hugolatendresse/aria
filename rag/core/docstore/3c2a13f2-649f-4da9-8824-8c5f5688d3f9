If the number of adjusted closed claims is within the range of any regression in its \nspecific accident year, we use interpolation. For example, accident year 1970 at age 48 has 8,231 \nadjusted closed claims, which is within the range of unadjusted closed claims between ages 36 \nand 48 (7,899; 8,291), then the paid claims for accident year 1970 at age 48 would be adjusted \nbased on such regression with a = 215 and b = 0.000468. Therefore, the adjusted paid claims for \naccident year 1970 at age 48 are equal to {215 x [e(0.000468 x 8,231)]} = 10,156. On the other hand, if \nthe number of adjusted closed claims is not within the range of all regression in its specific \naccident year, then extrapolation would be used to the regression that has the closest range. For \nexample, accident year 1969 at age 12 has 3,383 adjusted closed claim counts, in which the \nregression between ages 12 and 24 has the closest unadjusted closed claim count range (4,079; \n6,616) among all regressions in year 1969. Therefore, the adjusted paid claims for year 1969 at \nage 12 is calculated as {356 x [e(0.000411 x 3,383)]} = 1,431. \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheet 8, we analyze the adjusted paid claim development triangle and select \ndevelopment factors for each age-to-age maturity. At the bottom of this exhibit, we compare the \nselected development factors from the unadjusted paid claim triangle to those selected for the \nadjusted paid claim triangle. For both the adjusted and unadjusted paid claim development \ntriangles, we select factors based on the volume-weighted average for all years. We note that at \nall age-to-age maturities except 72-to-84 and 84-to-96 months, the selected development factors \nare higher based on the adjusted data than on the unadjusted data. This is consistent with our \nbelief that the rate of claims settlement has decreased in recent years and an unadjusted paid", "type": "Document"}}
