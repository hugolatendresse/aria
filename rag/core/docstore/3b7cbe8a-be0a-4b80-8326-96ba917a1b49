Typically, the actuary will \nalso calculate a multi-year average; the multi-year average may be a straight average or a weighted \naverage (a straight average is used in Table 7.1).  Generally, the actuary selects a ratio for each expense \ntype based on either the latest year\u2019s ratio or a multi-year average of ratios balanced with management \ninput, prior expense loads, and judgment.  There are several additional considerations that may affect the \nselection.  Because the ratemaking process is a projection of future costs, the actuary should select an \nexpense ratio consistent with what is expected in the future, and this may differ from a historical ratio.  \nExamples of this are as follows: \n\uf0b7 If the commission structure is changing, the actuary should use the expected commission percentage, \nnot the historical percentage.   \n7.2  Data Summization for All Variab le E xp ense M ethod\nExpe ns e Data Us e d Di vi de d B y\nGen e ra l Exp e n s e Co u n t ry wid e Ea rn e d  Pre miu m\nOther Acquisition Countrywide Written Premium\nCommis s ions  and Brokerage Countrywide/State Written Premium\nTaxes, Licenses, and Fees State Written Premium", "type": "Document"}}
