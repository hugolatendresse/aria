Some insurers \nmaintain claim development data on a quarterly basis. For these organizations, development \nfactors are readily available for quarterly analyses, and linear interpolation between quarters is \nlikely sufficient for monthly monitoring purposes. However, for insurers who only have annual \nclaim development data, linear interpolation of annual development patterns is usually not \nappropriate, particularly for the most immature accident years.  \n \nIn the paper \u201cThe Actuary and IBNR,\u201d Bornhuetter and Ferguson suggest:  \n \nIn the absence of data, it might be reasonable to assume that the cumulative \ndistribution of development by quarter for the most recent accident year is \nskewed say 40% at three months, 70% at six months, 85% at nine months, 100% \nat 12 months, and that the distribution for prior accident years is uniform: 25%, \n50%, 75%, 100%. Upon further study the authors were somewhat surprised to \nfind that their data revealed prior year\u2019s development were also skewed; \napproximate distribution: 33%, 60%, 80%, 100%.
