Nevertheless, we have specifically selected to use the term claims. \nThus, in this text, we refer to ultimate claims, expected claims, claim ratios, and claim adjustment \nexpenses.  \n \nWe differentiate between claims (dollar values) and claim counts (or number of claims). \n \n \nReported Claims \n \nIn this text, we use the term reported claims instead of incurred claims (or incurred losses). While \nthe term incurred losses is used by many throughout the P&C insurance industry, it can be \nmisunderstood as to whether or not it includes IBNR. Many actuaries use the labels case incurred \nor incurred on reported claims to specifically note that the losses do not include IBNR. For \nconsistency and simplicity throughout this book, we choose the term reported claims. Reported \nclaims (both in the text and exhibits of this book) generally refer to the sum of cumulative paid \nclaims and case outstanding estimates at a particular point in time. In certain methods or \ndiscussions, which are clearly defined in the text, we will refer to incremental instead of \ncumulative reported claims.  \n \n \nUltimate Claims \n \nUltimate claims represent the total dollar value after all claims are settled and closed without any \nchance of reopened claims.9 For some short-tail lines of insurance, such as some lines of property \ninsurance and automobile physical damage, insurers generally know the value of ultimate claims \nwithin a relatively short period of time, often within one or two years after the end of the accident \nperiod. However, for long-tail lines of insurance, such as U.S. general liability and workers \ncompensation, it may take many years, and in some situations even decades, before the insurer \nknows the value of ultimate claims.  \n \nA key step in the actuarial process of estimating unpaid claims is the projection of ultimate \nclaims. In this book we present numerous techniques for estimating unpaid claims. While you can", "type": "Document"}}
