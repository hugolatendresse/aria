First, it is the most commonly used and is therefore generally \naccepted.  Second, the data required for this approach is readily available.  Finally, the computations are \nvery straightforward.  \nThe main disadvantage of this approach is that the derivation involves making several simplifying \nassumptions that may not be true in practice (e.g., no variation in the size of losses).  Another \ndisadvantage of the classical credibility approach is that while it uses a selected complement, it does not \ntake into account the quality of the estimator compared to the latest observation and therefore judgment is \nrequired. \nThe actuary should consider the advantages and disadvantages above and determine whether this \napproach is appropriate for the particular ratemaking analysis.    \nB\u00fchlmann\tCredibility\t\nB\u00fchlmann credibility is commonly referred to as least squares credibility since the goal of this approach is \nto minimize the square of the error between the estimate and the true expected value of the quantity being \nestimated.
