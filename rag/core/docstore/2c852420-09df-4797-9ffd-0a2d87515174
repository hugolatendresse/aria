The 24-36 month medial average of the latest \n5x1 is 1.057 ((1.059 + 1.057 + 1.056) / 3). \n \nThe volume-weighted average is the weighted average using the amounts of reported claims (or \npaid claims) as weights. The formula for this type of average uses the sum of the claims for the \nspecific number of years divided by the sum of the claims for the same years at the previous age. \nFor example, the 36-48 month volume-weighted average of the latest three years is equal to the \nsum of the reported claims for accident years 2002 through 2004 as of 48 months ($57,703,851 + \n$57,015,411 + $56,976,657 = $171,695,919) divided by the sum of the reported claims for \naccident years 2002 through 2004 as of 36 months ($56,102,312 + $55,468,551 + $55,553,673 = \n$167,124,536), or 1.027. \n \nThe geometric average (also known as the geometric mean) for the latest four years is equal to the \nfourth root of the product of the last four age-to-age factors. For example, the geometric average for \nthe latest four years at 12-24 months is equal to (1.162 x 1.159 x 1.160 x 1.173) .25, or 1.164. \nSimilarly, for 48-60 months, the geometric average for the latest four years is equal to (1.010 x 1.014 \nx 1.011 x 1.010).25, or 1.011. \n \nFor U.S. Industry Auto, we present various averages for the more recent diagonals.
