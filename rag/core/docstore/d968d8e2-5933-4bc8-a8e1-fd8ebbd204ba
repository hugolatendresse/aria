The final base rate offset factor would be the original off-balance factor (1.0541) \ntimes the base rate adjustment to comply with the cap (0.9899).  These changes result in a 15.0% overall \nchange with no level\u2019s premium exceeding the 20.0% limit. \nPremium\tTransition\tRules\t\nThe last section dealt with capping the rate differential change for any one rating variable.  Even if caps \nare used to minimize this effect, the impact on an individual insured\u2019s premium can still be quite large if \nthe proposed rate change includes changes to several rating variables.  In other words, even if the change \nfor any one rating variable is small, the cumulative effect of the changes to all of the rating variables may \nbe significant.    \nThe company may wish to mitigate the premium impact for any single insured to reduce the probability \nthat the insured shops for a better deal.  In addition, a regulation or law may limit the increase an \ninsurance company may offer a renewing insured.  The company can try to alter the proposed rates such \nthat no insured\u2019s renewal increase exceeds the limit, but that may be practically impossible if the change \nincludes changes to multiple rating variables.  Consequently, the company may choose to pursue a \npremium transition rule.   \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)\nLevel Premium Current Selected\nRelativity \nChange\nOff-Balance \nFactor\nSelected \nOverall \nChange Total Change \nPremium \nShortfall if \nTotal Change \nCapped to \n20%\n1 138,000 $   0.8000    0.6500   -18.75% 1.0541 15.00% -1.51%\n2 659,000 $   1.0000    1.0000   0.00% 1.0541 15.00% 21.22% 8,040 $  \n3 203,000 $   1.2000    1.0500   -12.50% 1.0541 15.00% 6.07% - $  \nTotal 1,000,000$   -5.13% 1.0541 15.00% 15.00% 8,040 $  \n(10) Base Rate Adjustment to Comply with Cap 0.9899\n(11) Premium from Non-capped Levels (1, 3) 351,238$", "type": "Document"}}
