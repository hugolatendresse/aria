A prime application of Harwayne\u2019s method is when the subject experience is within a \nspecific geographical area (e.g., a state), and the desired complement of credibility considers related \nexperience in other geographical areas.  The other geographical areas (e.g., other states) have distinctly \ndifferent cost levels than the subject experience due to circumstances such as legal environment and \npopulation density.  For example, the pure premium may be 10% higher for every risk in a complement \nstate compared to the otherwise identical risks in the subject state; in this case, the actuary should adjust \nthe loss costs from that state prior to using them as a complement of credibility.   \nIn this application of Harwayne\u2019s method, the complement of credibility is determined using countrywide \ndata (excluding the base state being reviewed), but the countrywide data is adjusted to remove overall \ndifferences between states.  The following example illustrates the steps necessary to calculate the \ncomplement for class 1 of state A.   \n  \nThe first step is to calculate the average pure premium for state A: \n 3.33.125100\n4.001252.50100\nA \uf03d\uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03dL  \nThe next step is to calculate the average pure premium for states B and C based on the state A exposure \ndistribution by class: \n \n \n3.46.125100\n4.001252.78100\u02c6\n3.97,125100\n4.621253.16100\u02c6\nC\nB\n\uf03d\uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d\nL\nL\n \n  \n12.5 Harwayne Method\nState Class Exposure Losses\nPure \nPremium\nA 1 100 250 $        2.50      \n21 2 5 5 0 0 $        4.00      \nSubtotal 225 750 $        3.33      \nB1 1 9 0 6 0 0 $        3.16      \n23 2 5 1 , 5 0 0 $     4.62      \nSubtotal 515 2,100 $     4.08      \nC1 1 8 0 5 0 0 $        2.78      \n24 5 0 1 , 8 0 0 $     4.00      \nSubtotal 630 2,300 $     3.65", "type": "Document"}}
