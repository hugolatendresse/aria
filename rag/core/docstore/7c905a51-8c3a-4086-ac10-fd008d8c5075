In such cases the actuary may use the competitors\u2019 rates as a complement.  The \nrationalization is that if the competitors have a much larger number of exposures, the competitors\u2019 \nstatistics have less process error. \nEvaluation\t\nAn actuary must consider that competitors\u2019 manual rates are not only based on the competitors\u2019 loss costs \nbut also reflect marketing considerations, judgment, and the effects of the regulatory process\u2014all of \nwhich can introduce inaccuracy to the rates.  Competitors may also have different underwriting and claim \npractices than the subject company, which creates bias that may be difficult to quantify.  The competitors\u2019 \nrates will be independent of the company data. \nWhile the calculations may be straightforward, the data needed for this complement may be difficult or \ntime-consuming to obtain.  Even with the potential differences between competitors, the rates of a similar \ncompetitor bear a logical relationship and are generally accepted as a complement by regulators.  This \ncomplement is often considered the only viable alternative. \nExcess\tRatemaking\t\nExcess ratemaking usually deals with volatile and low volumes of data so the complement chosen is often \nmore important than the subject experience.  Complements for excess ratemaking are structured around \nthe special problems of excess ratemaking.  Typically there are very few claims in the excess layers; \nconsequently, actuaries try to predict the volume of excess loss costs using loss costs below the \nattachment point.  Losses for some lines of business (e.g., liability) may also be slow to develop, and", "type": "Document"}}
