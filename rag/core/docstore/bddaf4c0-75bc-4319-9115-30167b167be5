This was especially the case for \nprofessional liability insurance including medical malpractice.  As discussed in Chapter 6, claims for \nlong-tailed insurance products can take many years to report and settle.  Because of the long-tailed nature \nof professional liability, it took several years before insurance carriers realized that their products were \nsignificantly underpriced.  Once companies realized their rates were inadequate, they either reduced \ncoverage or filed for large rate increases or did both to try to improve profitability.  This delay in \nrecognizing price inadequacy highlights the significant pricing risk that exists for long-tailed insurance \nproducts relative to short-tailed ones.   \nThe long period between the occurrence of a claim and the settlement of a claim can be driven by a \nreporting lag (i.e., the time between the occurrence date and report date), a settlement lag (i.e., the time \nbetween the report date and settlement date), or both.  From a loss development perspective, reporting lag \nrelates to pure IBNR (claims that are incurred but not reported), and settlement lag relates to IBNER \n(claims that are incurred but not enough reported).  For a product like medical malpractice, it may be \nmany years before an insured becomes aware of a claim and reports it.  For example, it may take several \nyears for the physician\u2019s error to cause identifiable symptoms.  Even after the claim is reported, it may \ntake many years for the claim to be ultimately settled due to factors such as the need for ongoing \ntreatment and lengthy court proceedings.   \nIn an attempt to reduce the pricing risk inherent in professional liability, the industry introduced an", "type": "Document"}}
