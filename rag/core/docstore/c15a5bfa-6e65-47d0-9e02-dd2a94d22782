We organize the exhibits similarly to Exhibit I, Sheets 1 through 4. Exhibit II, \nSheets 1 and 2, contain the reported and paid claim development triangles, respectively. The \nchallenge of selecting age-to-age factors is much greater for the actuary in this example than in \nthe prior example. There is significant variability in the age-to-age factors down each column of \nthe triangle. For the reported claim triangle, almost all of the age-to-age factors along the \nDecember 31, 2004 diagonal are the highest in each column; the latest diagonal of age-to-age \nfactors is the lowest value in many of the columns. Based on our knowledge of the changing \nenvironment, we expect such variability in the age-to-age factors. In our example, we select age-\nto-age factors based on the volume-weighted average of the latest two years. (Keep in mind other \nfactor selections may also be reasonable.) In a situation of such major change, an actuary would \ntypically need to exercise a higher degree of judgment in selecting the age-to-age factors. \n \nWe present projected ultimate claims based on the development technique applied to reported and \npaid claims in Exhibit II, Sheet 3. In Exhibit II, Sheet 4, we summarize estimated IBNR and the \ntotal unpaid claim estimate based on the two development projections. In our first example for \nU.S. Industry Auto, the estimated IBNR generated by the reported and paid claim development \nmethods differs by approximately 10% and the estimate of total unpaid claims differs by only 4%. \nIn our second example for XYZ Insurer, the estimated IBNR using the paid claim development \ntechnique differs by 138% from the reported claims indication; the total unpaid claim estimate", "type": "Document"}}
