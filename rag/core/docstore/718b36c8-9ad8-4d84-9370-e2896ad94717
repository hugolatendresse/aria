In the loss ratio approach, however, it is \nimportant to bring earned premium to the current rate level of each class.  This is most accurately done \nvia extension of exposures, though the parallelogram method can be performed at the class level if data \nlimitations preclude use of extension of exposures. \nThe following table shows the calculations for the simple example:  \n \nColumn 4 displays the loss and ALAE ratio for each territory and in total, which is simply the losses and \nALAE divided by the premium at current rate level.  Column 5 is the indicated relativity change factor, \nwhich is the loss and ALAE ratio for each territory divided by the total loss and ALAE ratio.  This figure \nrepresents the amount the territory relativities should be changed to make the loss and ALAE ratios for \nevery territory equivalent.
