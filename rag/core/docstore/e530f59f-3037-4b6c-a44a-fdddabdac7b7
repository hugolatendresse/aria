Companies may examine the CPI at the component level (e.g., medical cost and construction cost \nindices) to find trends that are relevant to the insurance product being priced.     \nInsurance companies may also study geo-demographic data (i.e., average characteristics of a particular \narea).  In the U.S., census data is frequently used to supplement insurance data.  For example, population \ndensity can be an important predictor of the frequency of accidents.  Other examples of geo-demographic \ndata that may be useful include the following:  weather indices, theft indices, and average annual miles \ndriven.   \nAnother prime example of third-party data used by insurance companies is credit data.  Starting in the \n1990s, personal lines insurers began to evaluate the insurance loss experience of risks with different credit \nscores.  Insurers determined that credit is an important predictor of risk and began to vary rates \naccordingly.  More recently, commercial lines companies have analyzed similar data available for \ncorporations.  In addition to credit, there is a wealth of information available related to different insurance \nproducts.  The following are a few such examples for different insurance products: \n\uf0b7 Personal automobile insurance:  vehicle characteristics, department of motor vehicle records \n\uf0b7 Homeowners insurance:  distance to fire station \n\uf0b7 Earthquake insurance:  type of soil \n\uf0b7 Medical malpractice:  characteristics of hospital in which doctor practices \n\uf0b7 Commercial general liability:  type of owner (proprietor, stock) \n\uf0b7 Workers compensation:  OSHA inspection data. \nSUMMARY\t\t\nData is required for all ratemaking, and the quality of the ratemaking conclusions is heavily dependent on", "type": "Document"}}
