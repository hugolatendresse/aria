The \u201ctrend to\u201d date does not change (June 30, 2013), and the trend length is 2 years. \nFinally, if the proposed rates are expected to be in effect for more or less than one year, then the \u201ctrend \nto\u201d date for annual policies will also be different than explained above.  For example, if the proposed rates \nin the prior example are expected to be in effect for two years (from January 1, 2013 to December 31, \n2014 ), then the \u201ctrend to\u201d date for annual policies will be December 31, 2013, and the trend length is 3 \nyears. \nGiven the original trend period calculated earlier of 2.5 years, the adjustment to Calendar Year 2011 \nearned premium to account for premium trend on annual policies is:  \n1.0508 (= (1.0 + 0.02)2.5). \nIt is difficult to apply this approach when the changes in average premium vary significantly year-by-year \nand/or when the historical changes in average premium are significantly different than the changes that \nare expected in the future.  For example, if the company had forced all insureds to a higher deductible at \ntheir first renewal on or after January 1, 2011, the shift would have been completed by \nDecember 31, 2011, and the observed trend will not continue into the future.  When situations like this \noccur, companies may use a two-step trending approach.   \nTwo\u2010Step\tTrending\t\nTwo-step trending is also used in practice, especially when the company expects the premium trend to \nchange over time.  For example, some lines of business may require several historical years be used when \nprojecting premium for ratemaking purposes.  If the trend during that historical period has been \nsignificantly different from what is expected to occur in the future, it makes sense to adjust the historical", "type": "Document"}}
