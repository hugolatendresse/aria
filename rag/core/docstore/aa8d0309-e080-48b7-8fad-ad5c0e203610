The pricing actuary\u2019s role is to estimate expected losses and LAE for a future \npolicy period.  This is typically done based on aggregated historical data with a series of adjustments.  \nLosses need to be adjusted for non-recurring extreme events such as shock losses, catastrophes, and \nbenefit changes.  They also need to be adjusted to reflect ultimate settlement values and future cost levels.  \nThese latter adjustments are typically calculated based on examination of historical patterns of loss \ndevelopment and trend.  Finally, the actuary needs to incorporate any loss adjustment expenses that will \nbe paid to investigate and settle claims.   \nExamples of these loss and LAE adjustments and how they are incorporated in overall rate level analyses \nfor various lines of business are included in Appendices A-D.", "type": "Document"}}
