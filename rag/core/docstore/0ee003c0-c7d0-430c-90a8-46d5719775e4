In a stable environment, \nthe actuary expects to see stability in the claim experience down each column.  \n \nWe combine the premium data with the claim data and calculate two more diagnostic triangles: \nthe ratio of reported claims to earned premium (also known as the reported claim ratio) and the \nratio of reported claims to on-level earned premium.
