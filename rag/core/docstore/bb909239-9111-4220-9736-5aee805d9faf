For example, \nChart 13.8 shows a typical comparison of age relativities for personal automobile coverage.  In this graph, \nthe x-axis shows the different levels of the variable being studied (i.e., ages), the bars represent the \nnumber of vehicles for each level of age (right y-axis), and the lines represent the rate relativities by \ncompany (left y-axis). \n  \nThis type of competitive analysis can be very effective when the rating algorithms are similar between \ncompanies.  In recent years, rating algorithms have become much more complex, often including many \nmore risk characteristics than previously.  Consequently, individual rate relativity comparisons may be \nless meaningful.  For example, the above comparison of age relativities may not be useful if one company \nalso includes other age-related factors in its rating algorithm (e.g., retiree discounts, inexperienced \noperator surcharges) that the other company does not.  Additionally, rating variables may be additive for \none company and multiplicative for another company.  Because of this, companies have begun to use total \npremium comparisons for groups of risks sharing the rating characteristic of interest.  Chart 13.9 shows \nthe average premium by age rather than the rate relativities by age.   \nAge Relativities\n0.40\n0.90\n1.40\n1.90\n2.40\n2.90\nAge of Driver\nRelativity\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nVehicle Count\nVehicle Count\nCompany A\nCompany B\n13.8 Relativity Comparison", "type": "Document"}}
