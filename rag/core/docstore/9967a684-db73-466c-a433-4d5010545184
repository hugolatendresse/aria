Even if the competitive \nposition is similar across all age groups, this result is not surprising as younger insureds tend to be more \nprice-sensitive.  Similar information can be examined for retention and growth. \nDistributional\tAnalysis\t\nCompanies may also examine distributions of new and renewal business by customer segment.  A \ndistributional analysis normally includes both the distribution by segment at a given point of time and \nchanges in distributions over time. \nFor example, a company may examine the distribution of policies by various amounts of insurance (AOI) \ncategories for homeowners.  For additional information, the average premium for each category is \nincluded.
