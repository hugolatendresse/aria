Until the claimant reports the claim to the insurer (i.e., the report date) the insurer is unaware \nof the claim.  Claims not currently known by the insurer are referred to as unreported claims or \nincurred but not reported (IBNR) claims.  After the report date, the claim is known to the company and \nis classified as a reported claim.  Until the claim is settled, the reported claim is considered an open claim.  \nOnce the claim is settled, it is categorized as a closed claim.  In some instances, further activity may occur \nafter the claim is closed, and the claim may be re-opened.    \nLoss\t\t\nLoss is the amount of compensation paid or payable to the claimant under the terms of the insurance \npolicy.  The actuarial community occasionally uses the terms losses and claims interchangeably.  This \ntext uses the term claim to refer to the demand for compensation, and loss to refer to the amount of \ncompensation.  This terminology is more common in ratemaking contexts, particularly as the loss ratio (to \nbe defined later in this chapter) is one of the fundamental ratemaking metrics. \nThe terms associated with losses are paid loss, case reserve, reported or case incurred loss, IBNR/IBNER \nreserve, and ultimate loss.  Paid losses, as the name suggests, are those amounts that have been paid to \nclaimants.  When a claim is reported and payment is expected to be made in the future, the insurer \nestablishes a case reserve, which is an estimate of the amount of money required to ultimately settle that \nclaim.  The case reserve excludes any payments already made.  The amount of the case reserve is \nmonitored and adjusted as payments are made and additional information is obtained about the damages.  \nReported loss or case incurred loss is the sum of the paid losses and the current case reserve for that \nclaim:  \n Reserve.
