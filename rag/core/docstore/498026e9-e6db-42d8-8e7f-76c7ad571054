Thus, the ratio of case outstanding to previous case outstanding for accident year \n2004 at 36 months is 0.567 ($6,316,995/$11,150,459). At the bottom of Exhibit I, Sheet 3, we \ncalculate various averages and select ratios based on the simple average for the latest three years. \nFor the ratio to ultimate, we judgmentally select 0.00. In other words, we make a simplifying \nassumption in this example for U.S. Industry Auto that there will be no case outstanding \nremaining for 132 months and later.71 \n \nA challenge of this technique is the selection of the \u201cto ultimate\u201d ratios for both the ratio of \nincremental paid claims to previous case outstanding and the ratio of case outstanding to previous \ncase outstanding. These concepts are not frequently used nor are there readily available \nbenchmarks for comparison purposes.   \n \nThe goal of the case outstanding development method is to project ultimate claims based on \ncompleting the square of incremental paid claims. In this method, the incremental paid claims in \neach interval are related to the case outstanding at the beginning of the interval. Thus, the next \nstep is to complete the square of the case outstanding triangle. We will then be able to project the \nincremental paid claims using the completed square of case outstanding.  \n \nWe use the selected ratios of case outstanding to previous case outstanding in Exhibit I, Sheet 3, \nto project the case outstanding for each accident year and age combination in Exhibit I, Sheet 4. \nExamples will assist in understanding the mechanics of this projection. For accident year 1999, \nthe projected case outstanding at 120 months of $107,435 is equal to the 0.580 selected ratio at \n120 months multiplied by the case outstanding at 108 months of $185,233. Similarly, for accident \nyear 2007, the projected case outstanding at 24 months of $11,374,010 is equal to the 0.526", "type": "Document"}}
