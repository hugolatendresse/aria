More detailed information on the actuary\u2019s responsibility with \nrespect to data quality is contained in \u201cActuarial Standard of Practice No. 23, Data Quality\u201d (Actuarial \nStandards Board of the American Academy of Actuaries).  \nRisk\tData\t\nRatemaking analysis ultimately requires information about policy exposure and premium linked with the \ncorresponding claim and loss information.  Company databases, however, typically record this \ninformation in two separate databases:  a policy database and a claim database.   \nPolicy\tDatabase\t\nThe policy database is defined according to records (i.e., individual policies or some further subdivision \nof the policy) and fields (i.e., explanatory information about the record).  The way a record is defined for \na particular product\u2019s policy database depends on the exposure measure and the way premium is typically \ncalculated.  The following are examples of policy database organization for different lines of business: \n\uf0b7 In homeowners insurance, a record may be a home for an annual policy period. \n\uf0b7 In U.S. workers compensation insurance, rating is based on the payroll of relevant industry \nclassifications so separate records are often maintained at the classification level.6 \n\uf0b7 In personal auto insurance, separate records are typically created for each coverage\u2014though this \ncould also be handled via a coverage indicator field in the database.  Separate records also may be \ncreated for each individual auto on a policy (if multiple autos are insured on one policy); \nmoreover, separate records may be maintained for individual operators on each auto.
