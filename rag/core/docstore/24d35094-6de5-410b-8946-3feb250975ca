Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) are expenses that can be \nassigned to a specific claim and are included on the claim database.  If ALAE can be subdivided \ninto finer categorization, additional fields may be used accordingly.  Unallocated loss adjustment \nexpenses (ULAE) cannot be assigned to a specific claim and are handled elsewhere.  For many \ninsurance products, companies do not set ALAE reserves and only payments are tracked on the \ndatabase.  If the company sets a case reserve for ALAE, it is maintained in the database.  As with \nlosses, this is captured separately by coverage or peril and by catastrophe or non-catastrophe, if \napplicable.   \n\uf0b7 Salvage/subrogation:  Companies may be able to recoup some payments made to the insured.  If \na company replaces property, the company assumes ownership of the damaged property.  The \ndamaged property may then be reconditioned and sold to offset part of the payments made for the \nloss; these recoveries are called salvage.  When a company pays for an insured\u2019s loss, the \ncompany receives the rights to subrogate (i.e., to recover any damages from a third party who was \nat fault or contributed fault to the loss event).  Any salvage or subrogation that offsets the loss is \ntracked and linked to the original claim, if possible. \n\uf0b7 Claim characteristics:  Companies may collect characteristics associated with the claims (e.g., \ntype of injury, physician information).  If this information is available, it is included on the claim \ndatabase to the extent the analyst may want to study the characteristic.  However, it is important \nto note that while studying the impacts of these characteristics on average claim size may be \ninteresting for certain purposes (e.g., loss reserve studies), only characteristics known for every", "type": "Document"}}
