The incremental claim payments during 2009 are \n$2,000 and the change in case outstanding is $30,000 ($30,000 ending case outstanding minus $0 \nbeginning case outstanding). The reported claims over the period January 1, 2010 to \nDecember 31, 2010 are -$6,000. The incremental claim payments in 2010 are $24,000 and the \nchange in case outstanding is -$30,000 (ending case outstanding of $0 minus beginning case \noutstanding of $30,000). You can use similar calculations to derive the reported claims during \n2011 and 2012. \n \nAs indicated above, we use the term \u201creported claims\u201d under two contexts, incremental and \ncumulative, and it is important to look at the time period involved to differentiate between these \ntwo contexts. For a particular claim or the aggregate of a group of claims, we can summarize \nreported claims at a specific point in time. In such a context, reported claims are equal to the sum \nof cumulative paid claims through a specific date and case outstanding as of that same date. Many \nactuarial projection techniques rely on this definition of reported claims.  \n \nReported claims can also refer to the claim activity over an interval of time. An example of \nreported claims used in this context is the insurer\u2019s income statement. As previously mentioned, \nwe define the reported claims over a period of time using the following formulae: \n \n   Reported claims = reported claims at end of period \u2013 reported claims at beginning of period \n \n   Reported claims = paid claims during period + case outstanding at end of period \n \u2013 case outstanding at beginning of period \n \n \nFurther Claim Examples \n \nIn Table 2 (on the following page), we present additional illustrations of how claim transactions can \naffect reported claims.
