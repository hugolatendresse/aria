For example, the paid claims and \nexpense for accident year 2006 in the above triangle were $100 billion through year-end 2006, \nand increased to $150 billion through year-end 2007; the change from $100 billion to $150 billion \nis the development in this quantity.   \n \nActuaries are frequently interested in the typical development for a cohort over time. This is \ngenerally easier to observe by looking at the age (or maturity) of the cohort rather than the \naccounting date for the cohort. The above triangle reformatted to reflect this approach is \npresented in Table 2 below.  \n \nTable 2 \u2013 Paid Claims and Expenses ($US Billions) \n by Age\nAccident Year 12 Months 24 Months 36 Months \n2006 100 150 170 \n2007 110 161  \n2008 115   \n \nThe age (or maturity) is generally measured in terms of the time from the start of the cohort \nperiod. For example, the age of the 2006 accident year valued at year-end 2006 is 12 months \n(from the start of the accident year). Similarly, the age of the 2006 accident year valued at year-\nend 2007 is 24 months (from the start of the accident year).", "type": "Document"}}
