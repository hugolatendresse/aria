We know from a review of claims data that there are several open claims for the most \nrecent accident years in litigation with large case outstanding values and minimal payments to \ndate.  \n \nAfter discussion with management about the specific categories of costs underlying the paid \nULAE, its expectations for the upcoming several years, and a review of current claims data, we \nselect a ratio of 0.07 for estimating unpaid ULAE. Thus, for New Small Insurer, we estimate \nunpaid ULAE at 12/31/08 of $457,975 using total IBNR and $236,761 using pure IBNR. \n \n $ 4 5 7 , 9 7 5  =  [ ( 0 . 0 7 0  x  5 0 %  x  $ 2 2 5 , 0 0 0 )  +  ( 0 . 0 7 0  x  1 0 0 %  x  $ 6 , 4 3 0 , 0 0 0 ) ]  \n \n$236,761 = {[0.070 x 50% x ($225,000 + (6,430,000 \u2013 109,588))] + [0.070 x 100% x \n$109,588]} \n \n \nWhen the Mango-Allen Refinement Works and When it Does Not \n \nThe Mango-Allen refinement is a valuable alternative for insurers with limited experience or \nhighly volatile claims payment experience. For such insurers, a method using reported claims \ninstead of paid claims may provide a more stable base for projection purposes. However, for \norganizations with a sufficient volume of paid claims experience, the additional calculations \nrequired to estimate expected paid claims may not be necessary as the relative improvement to \nthe accuracy of projected unpaid ULAE may not justify the time and costs involved. \n \n \nCount-Based Techniques \n \nMango and Allen describe two major drawbacks of the use of claims as a base for comparison \nrelative to the use of claim counts for estimating unpaid ULAE.105 First, the amount of ULAE is \nnot solely dependent on the magnitude of the accompanying claim dollars. ULAE is also \ndependent on the average claim size. For example, we expect that the ULAE required to settle a \none million-dollar claim is probably less than the ULAE required to settle ten $100,000 claims.", "type": "Document"}}
