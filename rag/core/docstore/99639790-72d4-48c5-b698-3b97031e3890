The average premium should be calculated on \nan exposure basis rather than a policy basis, and it is important to calculate the average premium using the \nexposure base that underlies the rate. \nThe actuary also must decide whether to use earned or written premium.  Earned premium is used in most \nother parts of the ratemaking analysis and may seem like a more natural choice; however, written \npremium data reflects shifts in the distribution more quickly than earned premium does.  In other words, \nwritten premium is a leading indicator of trends that will eventually emerge in earned premium and as \nsuch, the trends observed in written premium are appropriate to apply to historical earned premium.  \nAssuming an adequate amount of data, the actuary will often use quarterly average written premium (as \nopposed to annual average written premium) to make the statistic as responsive as possible.   \nThe following table shows data typically used to estimate premium trend due to distributional changes: \n \nThe annual changes in average written premium are used to determine the amount the historical premium \nneeds to be adjusted to account for premium trend.  Note the premium used for this table has already been \nadjusted to the current rate level.  If that is not done, the data will show an abrupt change in the average \nwritten premium corresponding to the effective date of the rate change.  Allowing that change to \ninfluence the premium trend selection essentially adjusts for current rate level twice (once in the explicit \ncurrent rate level adjustment and once in trend).     \nThere are two methods for adjusting historical data for premium trend:  one-step and two-step trending.    \n5.24  Change in Average WP\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nQuarter\nWritten \nPremium at \nCurrent Rate \nLevel\nWritten \nExposures\nAverage \nWritten \nPremium at \nCurrent \nRate Level\nAnnual \nChange\n1Q09 323,189.17$   453 713.44 $       --", "type": "Document"}}
