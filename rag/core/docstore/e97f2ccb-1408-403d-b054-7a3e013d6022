The strength of the \nindirect effect is a function of the economic environment and the nature of the insured population, among \nother things.  Assuming there is no data to estimate the indirect effect, it needs to be determined \njudgmentally. \nOnce the effect of the benefit change is quantified, the ratemaking actuary must consider the timing and \ndetails of the benefit change in order to adjust the historical data.  For example, a benefit change may \naffect all claims on or after a certain date or claims arising from all policies written on or after the date.  \nThe necessary adjustment is different in each of those cases.   \nTechniques for calculating the appropriate adjustment are similar to the parallelogram method for \nderiving on-level premium in the previous chapter on premium.  Figure 6.7 shows a law change \nimplemented on August 15, 2010 that only affects \nlosses on policies written on or after August 15, 2010.  \nThe direct effect of the change for annual policies on \nan accident year basis is estimated at +5%. \nSince the law change is only applicable to losses on \npolicies written after the implementation date, the \nline dividing the losses into pre- and post-change is a \ndiagonal line representing a policy effective on the \ndate of the law change.  Note that the calendar-\naccident years have been divided into accident \nquarters.  Recall that the parallelogram method assumes a uniform distribution of written premium (or in \nthis case, of losses).  The uniform distribution assumption may not be appropriate for losses that are \naffected by seasonality; therefore, it is prudent to measure loss adjustments at a more refined level than \nyears.  Similar to the on-level premium adjustment factor, the benefit change loss adjustment factor is: \n.Period  Historical  of  Level  Loss  Average\nLevel  LossCurrent    Adjustment\uf03d", "type": "Document"}}
