What is the correct age-to-age factor when a \nportfolio is changing its composition? In our example, commercial automobile has a longer \nreporting pattern than private passenger automobile and thus requires the selection of higher age-\nto-age factors. Since the proportion of commercial automobile claims is increasing in the \nportfolio, we see increasing age-to-age factors in our experience. Changing from a five-year \nvolume-weighted average to a three-year volume-weighted average for selecting age-to-age \nfactors would help move the estimated IBNR closer to the actual IBNR, but we would still fall \nshort by a significant amount. \n \nIn this situation, the reported claim development method is more responsive than the paid claim \ndevelopment method due to the shorter time frame in which claims are reported versus paid. \nHowever, both methods result in estimated IBNR that are significantly lower than the actual \nIBNR. This example illustrates how changes in the portfolio could result in serious distortions in \nthe development technique. Within a single line of insurance, changes in the types of claims that \nare occurring could have a similar effect. \n \n \n105", "type": "Document"}}
