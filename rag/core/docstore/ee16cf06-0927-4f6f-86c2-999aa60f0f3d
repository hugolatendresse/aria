The most common loss ratio \nmetric is reported loss ratio, or reported losses divided by earned premium.  Continuing the example \noutlined above, if premium earned during the calendar year is $32,000,000, the calendar-accident year \nreported loss ratio as of 18 months is 58.6% ( = $18,750,000 / $32,000,000). \nADJUSTMENTS\tTO\tLOSSES\t\nLosses need to be projected to the cost level expected when the rates will be in effect.  This is typically \ndone using historical losses with a series of adjustments.  Preliminary adjustments may involve removing \nextraordinary events (e.g., individual shock losses and catastrophe losses) from historical losses and \nreplacing them with a provision more in line with long-term expectations.  Immature losses also need to \nbe developed to reflect their ultimate settlement value.  Further adjustments may be applied to restate \nlosses to the benefit and cost levels expected during the future policy period.   \nThis text will not prescribe a specific order for the various adjustments to historical losses.  The actuary \nneeds to consider how each adjustment is derived in order to assess the order of application.  For example, \nif a catastrophe model outputs ultimate catastrophe losses expected in the future policy period, this \nprovision should be added to non-catastrophe losses that have already been trended and developed to \nultimate.  If the catastrophe provision is added to non-catastrophe losses, and the sum is then trended and \ndeveloped, the expected catastrophe losses will be over-adjusted.", "type": "Document"}}
