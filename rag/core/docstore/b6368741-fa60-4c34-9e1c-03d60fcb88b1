While this situation is not particularly common, it can occur, particularly for \nolder years. The absence of historical cumulative paid claims can arise following times of \ntransition such as mergers and acquisitions of corporations with self-insurance programs or \nconsolidation or amalgamation of self-insured public entities. Some organizations create self-\ninsurance programs to address insurance coverage needs that are not readily met in the \ncommercial market. Such organizations may have complete data for the years following the start \nof the formal self-insurance program; however, the only information that may be available for \nyears prior to the commencement of the self-insurance program may be current case outstanding \nfor claims in the process of investigation and settlement. \n \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nIn this example (called Self-Insurer Case Only), we use the standard development technique with \ncase outstanding to project an estimate of total unpaid claims for a self-insured entity of general \nliability coverage. In Chapter 7, we described the development technique and demonstrated its \nuse with reported and paid claims. The key assumptions presented in Chapter 7 are equally \napplicable in our Self-Insurer Case Only example. We use industry-based reporting and payment \ndevelopment patterns to derive case outstanding development patterns. Thus, we implicitly", "type": "Document"}}
