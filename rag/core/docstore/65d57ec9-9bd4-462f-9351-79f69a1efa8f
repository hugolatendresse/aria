Adjacency-based smoothing handles urban/rural differences more \nappropriately, and accounts for natural or artificial boundaries better than the distance-based smoothing.  \nFor these reasons, adjacency-based smoothing tends to be most appropriate for perils driven heavily by \nsocio-demographic characteristics (e.g., theft).   \nWhether distance or adjacency-based smoothing is used, the actuary needs to balance over- and under-\nsmoothing.  If the actuary smoothes too much (e.g., uses data from dissimilar units in another part of the \nstate), the actuary may be masking the real spatial variation among the risks.  If the actuary does not \nsmooth enough, the actuary may be leaving considerable noise in the estimator.   \nThe exact mechanics of the various spatial smoothing techniques are beyond the scope of this text. \nSmoothing techniques are generally applied in one of two ways.  First, smoothing techniques can be \napplied to the geographic estimators themselves.  This is most commonly done when the geographic \nestimator is based on the univariate approaches as the estimators generally still contain a significant \namount of noise.  Second, these techniques can be applied within a more sophisticated framework to \nimprove the predictive power of a multivariate analysis of geographical effects.  In this case, the actuary \napplies smoothing techniques to the geographic residuals to see if there are any patterns in the residuals; \nActual Experience\nSignal\nNon-\nGeographic\nGeographic \nPredictors\nGeographic \nResidual \nVariation\nNoise\n11.2  Components of Actual Experience Further Refined", "type": "Document"}}
