They also allow a function, called the link function, to define the relationship \nbetween the expected response variable (e.g., claim severity) and the linear combination of the predictor \nvariables (e.g., age of home, amount of insurance, etc.).  The choice of various link functions means the \npredictor variables do not have to relate strictly in an additive fashion (as they do with LMs).  For \nexample, GLMs fit to insurance claims experience for ratemaking purposes often specify a log link \nfunction, which assumes the rating variables relate multiplicatively to one another.  There are other \ncomponents of the GLM formularization (offset terms, prior weights) that are beyond the scope of this \ntext. \nIn order to solve a GLM, the modeler must: \n\uf0b7 Supply a modeling dataset with a suitable number of observations of the response variable and \nassociated predictor variables to be considered for modeling. \n\uf0b7 Select a link function to define the relationship between the systematic and random components. \n\uf0b7 Specify the distribution of the underlying random process, typically a member of the exponential \nfamily of distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, gamma, binomial, inverse Gaussian33); this is done \nby specifying the mean and the variance of the distribution, the latter being a function of the \nmean. \n \nThe maximum likelihood approach then maximizes the logarithm of the likelihood function and computes \nthe predicted values for each variable. \nMore comprehensive detail on the theory of GLMs is beyond the scope of this text, but may be found in \nSection 1 of \u201cThe Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Generalized Linear Models\u201d (Anderson , D. et al. 2005).\t\nSAMPLE\tGLM\tOUTPUT\t\nUnlike univariate analysis of claims experience that is typically performed on either loss ratios or loss", "type": "Document"}}
