The estimated S&S recoverable represent a reduction to total estimate of unpaid claims for \nthe insurer. \n \n  \nReinsurance and Aggregate Limits \n \nAll of the different types of techniques for estimating unpaid claims presented in Chapters 7 \nthrough 13 can be applied to gross, ceded, or net of reinsurance claims experience. When required \nto estimate unpaid claims on a net of reinsurance basis, actuaries vary in their approach. Some \nactuaries analyze gross (i.e., direct and assumed) and ceded experience separately; others analyze \ngross and net experience separately. The choice of a gross versus net versus ceded analysis may \ndepend on data availability, characteristics of the gross versus ceded program, and also personal \npreferences of the actuary. Some insurers code ceded claims in the same information system as \nthe gross data; thus, the net data is readily available. For such insurers, the actuary is more likely \nto conduct both gross and net analyses. On the other hand, some insurers code the ceded claims \ndata to a different system; thus matching the gross and ceded data to derive net claim triangles \nmay be more difficult. For these insurers, the actuary will likely prepare separate gross and ceded \nanalyses. Furthermore, the choice of gross versus net versus ceded analysis may be a function of \ndata volume and quality.  \n \n                                                 \n79 To present a complete example for the reader of this text, we use the development method with paid and \nreported claims to project ultimate claims for Auto Physical Damage. However, we could use many other \nprojection methods to derive ultimate claims. The ratio method for determining ultimate S&S is \nindependent of any specific methodology for estimating ultimate claims.  \n330", "type": "Document"}}
