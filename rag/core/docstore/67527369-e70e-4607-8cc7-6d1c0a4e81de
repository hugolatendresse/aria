A shift in emphasis by the claims department affecting its propensity to settle large claims \nversus small claims is an example of an operational change that could affect many types of data \nthat actuaries typically use for estimating unpaid claims. For example, greater attention to large \nclaims could result in an overall slowdown in the rate of total claim settlements. If claims \nadjusters focus on the larger claims, which are typically fewer in number, more complex, and \nrequire a longer period of time to settle than small claims, the small claims may not be settled at \nthe same rate as in the past. Furthermore, with greater attention directed at the handling of large \nclaims, there may be a speed-up in the settlement of these particular claims that could affect both \nthe paid claims and case outstanding triangles; if the large claims are settled earlier then the case \noutstanding will no longer be present in the triangle at the later maturities and the payments will \nappear in the triangles at earlier maturities than in the past. Also, without appropriate attention, \nthe smaller claims may become larger claims more quickly than past experience would suggest. \n \n \nTreat Problem Areas through Data Adjustment \n \nIn some circumstances, the actuary is not able to sufficiently address the effect of changes in \noperations through data selection and rearrangement. In these situations, Berquist and Sherman \nintroduce two techniques for quantitative adjustments to the data prior to application of traditional \ndevelopment techniques. The first technique adjusts the case outstanding triangle when there have \nbeen changes in the adequacy of case outstanding. The second technique adjusts the paid claim \ntriangle where there have been changes in the rate of claims settlement.", "type": "Document"}}
