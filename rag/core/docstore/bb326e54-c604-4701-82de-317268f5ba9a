We know \nthat the underlying assumptions of some of the methods do not hold true for XYZ Insurer as a \nresult of recent changes in both its internal operations as well as the external environment. To \ndemonstrate the influence of the Berquist-Sherman adjustments on the projected ultimate claims, \nwe summarize in Exhibit I, Sheet 1, the projected ultimate claims from the following methods: \n \n\uf0be Reported and paid claim development techniques based on unadjusted reported and paid claims \n \n\uf0be Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique based on unadjusted reported and paid claim development \npatterns \n \n\uf0be Cape Cod method based on unadjusted reported claim development pattern \n \n\uf0be Reported and paid claim development techniques incorporating Berquist-Sherman \nadjustments to case outstanding only, paid claims only, as well as to both case outstanding \nand paid claims \n \n\uf0be Bornhuetter-Ferguson based on adjusted reported and paid claim development patterns as \nwell as revised expected claim ratios \n \nThe calculations for the revised Bornhuetter-Ferguson incorporating the Berquist-Sherman \nadjustments on development patterns and the expected claim ratio are not included in this book. \nWe suggest that the user of this book reproduce these calculations to ensure a greater \nunderstanding of the mechanics of each method. \n \nSince we know that using unadjusted data does not satisfy the underlying assumptions for the first \nthree projection techniques above, we do not consider these projections when selecting ultimate \nclaims for XYZ Insurer. We also do not consider the Berquist-Sherman adjustment for case \noutstanding only since this projection does not reflect the changes observed in settlement rates.", "type": "Document"}}
