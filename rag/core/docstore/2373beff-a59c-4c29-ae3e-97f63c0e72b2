In South Africa, some insurers differentiate between \u201chousehold content\u201d and \n\u201chousehold building\u201d insurance.  \n \nSome of the major coverages for U.S. P&C insurers, such as workers compensation or medical \nmalpractice, may not exist at all in other countries, or if they exist, they may operate in a very \ndifferent way. For example, in Canada, workers compensation insurance is not categorized as a \nP&C insurance coverage and is not sold by insurers. Instead, Canadian workers compensation \ncoverage is provided by monopolistic provincial funds; pension and life (not P&C) actuaries \ntypically provide actuarial services to the provincial workers compensation funds.  \n \n                                                 \n6 In a number of countries (e.g., Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and South Africa), insurers are \nrequired to hold provisions (i.e., the estimate of unpaid claims) at the 75% confidence level.  \n10", "type": "Document"}}
