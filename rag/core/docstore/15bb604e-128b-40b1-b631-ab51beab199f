These expenses must be excluded from the calculation of the historical \nexpense ratios when performing the analysis for business written in the state.  If such expenses are \nrecurring, overall future income will be reduced by that state\u2019s proportion of the expenses.   \nIn the example shown in Table 7.1, there were no extraordinary expenses and a three-year straight \naverage expense ratio is selected.   \nThis procedure is repeated for each of the expense categories.  The sum of the selections for each expense \ncategory represents the total expense provision.  This provision is used directly in the loss ratio or pure \npremium rate level indication formulae discussed in Chapter 8. \nPotential\tDistortions\tUsing\tthis\tApproach\t\nBy definition, this procedure assumes that all expenses vary directly with premium and there are no fixed \nexpenses yet some expenses may be constant or nearly constant for each risk.  By treating all expenses as \nvariable and incorporating them in the rates via a percentage loading, the expense provision in the rates \nvaries directly with the size of the premium.  Consequently, this approach understates the premium need \nfor risks with a relatively small policy premium and overstates the premium need for risks with relatively \nlarge policy premium.   \nReturning to the simple example outlined at the onset of the chapter, the $20 of fixed expense ( FE ) will \nbe included as a percentage with the other 15% of variable expenses (V).  Using the final premium of \n$250, the $20 can be converted into a ratio of 8% (= $20 / $250).  Treating all expenses as variable, the \npremium calculation becomes:", "type": "Document"}}
