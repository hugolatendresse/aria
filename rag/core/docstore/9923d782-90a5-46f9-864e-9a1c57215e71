The remainder of this chapter describes and \nevaluates different methods for developing complements of credibility for both first dollar ratemaking and \nexcess ratemaking.  First dollar ratemaking is performed on products that cover claims from the first \ndollar of loss (or after some small deductible) up to some limit.  Personal automobile, homeowners, \nworkers compensation, and professional liability insurance are good examples of first dollar products.  In \nfirst dollar ratemaking, historical losses are used for the base statistic, and they are generally the same \nmagnitude as the true expected losses.  In contrast to first dollar products, excess insurance products cover \nclaims that exceed some high attachment point.  Personal umbrella policies, large deductible commercial \npolicies, and excess reinsurance are good examples of excess products.", "type": "Document"}}
