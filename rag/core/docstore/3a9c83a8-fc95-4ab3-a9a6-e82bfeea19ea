More detail on this alternative \napproach to trending can be found in Chris Styrsky\u2019s paper \u201cThe Effect of Changing Exposure Levels on \nCalendar Year Loss Trends\u201d (Styrsky, 2005). \nLeveraged\tEffect\tof\tLimits\ton\tSeverity\tTrend\t\t\nWhen the loss experience being analyzed is subject to the application of limits, it is important that the \nleveraged effect of those limits on the severity trend be considered.  Basic limits ratemaking was \ndiscussed in an earlier section.  Recall basic limits losses are losses that have been censored at a pre-\ndefined limit referred to as a \u201cbasic limit.\u201d  Total limits losses are losses that are uncensored, and excess \nlimits are the portion of the losses that exceed the basic limit (or the difference between total limits and \nbasic limits losses).  It is important to understand that severity trend affects each of these differently. \nConsider the following simple example in which every total limits loss is subject to a 10% severity trend. \n \nAs can be seen in the table above, the 10% trend in total limits losses affects basic limits losses and \nexcess losses differently.  On average, the 10% total limits trend is dampened to 3.5% when considering \nthe basic limits losses.  The two smallest losses (Claims 1 and 2) are significantly below the limit of \n$25,000 and were still under $25,000 even after the 10% increase.
