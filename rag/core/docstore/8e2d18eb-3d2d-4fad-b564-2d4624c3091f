We also use the development technique with \nadjusted reported claims, whereby claims are adjusted to reflect changes in case outstanding \nadequacy. In Exhibit II, we compare ultimate claims and estimated IBNR. We are limited in the \ndiagnostics we can perform for both the Berquist-Sherman examples since we do not have \ncomplete claim count data. \n \nIn our analysis, it is clear from the diagnostics that an increase in case outstanding strength \noccurred during the experience period. Thus, the development method based on unadjusted \nreported claims is not appropriate since an underlying assumption of this technique is not valid \n(i.e., case outstanding adequacy did not remain constant over the experience period). Since the \ntwo remaining methods (i.e., unadjusted paid claim development and adjusted reported claim \ndevelopment) produce such significant differences, the actuary should seek additional \ninformation, including the potential use of other methodologies, before making a final \ndetermination as to ultimate claims and thus the unpaid claim estimate. \n \nFor Berq-Sher Auto BI Insurer, we develop four estimates of ultimate claims using the \ndevelopment technique. First, we project ultimate claims based on unadjusted paid claims data. \nWe then adjust the paid claims data for changes in the rate of claims settlement and develop three", "type": "Document"}}
