Assume the losses capped at $500,000 are $2,000,000 \nand the following increased limits factors apply:  \n \nThe complement of credibility is calculated as follows: \n400,000.1.02.50\n3.00$2,000,000 \uf03d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf0b4\uf03dC  \nEvaluation\t\nIf the subject experience has a different size of loss distribution than that used to develop the increased \nlimits factors, then the results of this procedure will be biased.  This is particularly relevant as the \nincreased limits factors may be based on industry data rather than the insurer\u2019s own data.  Despite the \nissues with the accuracy, this is often the best available estimate. \nThe error with this approach is not the process error but rather the parameter error associated with the \nselection of the increased limits factors.  Thus, the error associated with this estimate tends to be \nindependent of the error associated with the base statistic.   \n12.6 I LFs\n Limit of \nLiability \nIncreased \nLimits  \nFactor\n100,000$    1.00\n250,000$    1.75\n500,000$    2.50\n750,000$    3.00\n1,000,000$ 3.40", "type": "Document"}}
