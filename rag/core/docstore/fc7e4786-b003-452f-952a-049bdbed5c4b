UW  Expenses UW  LAE  Losses  Premium \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  \nThis chapter covers the premium component of the fundamental insurance equation.  Premium is the price \nthe insured pays for the insurance product.  The ratemaking process requires estimation of premium for a \nfuture policy period.  This process generally begins with historical premium and applies a series of \nadjustments.  The first adjustment is to bring the historical premium to the rate level currently in effect.  \nWithout this adjustment, any rate changes during or after the historical period will not be fully reflected in \nthe historical premium and will distort the projection.  A second adjustment is to develop premium to \nultimate levels if the premium is still changing.  A third adjustment is to project the historical premium to \nthe premium level expected in the future.  This accounts for changes in the mix of business that have \noccurred or are expected to occur after the historical experience period.  These concepts are explained in \ndetail in this chapter; in addition, Appendices A, C, and D provide realistic numeric examples from \nvarious lines of business of the premium adjustments made in ratemaking analysis. \nAs will be discussed in depth in the chapter on overall rate level indication, there are two general \napproaches to evaluate whether the rates underlying the company\u2019s premium adequately cover expected \nlosses, expenses, and target underwriting profit:  the pure premium approach and the loss ratio approach.  \nOnly the loss ratio approach requires the actuary to estimate the premium to be collected during the future", "type": "Document"}}
