The used-up premium in Column (7) is equal to the earned premium in Column \n(2) multiplied by the percentage of claims reported in Column (6). Reinsurers often use ultimate \npremiums in Column (2) instead of earned premium. In Column (8), we calculate estimated claim \nratios, by accident year, by dividing actual reported claims from Column (4) by the used-up \npremium in Column (7). (An alternative to the use of premium and claim ratios is exposures and \npure premiums. Instead of calculating used-up premium, the actuary could calculate used-up \nexposures and calculate estimated pure premiums instead of estimated claim ratios for each year \nin the experience period.) \n \nIn our U.S. Industry Auto example, we observe a change in the claim ratios for the latest accident \nyears when compared with the earliest years (i.e., 1998 through 2002). The average estimated \nclaim ratio for accident years 1998 through 2002 is 75.2%. For this period of time, the claim \nratios vary from a low of 69.6% to a high of 79.7%. We contrast this with the more recent years\u2019 \nexperience, which has an average claim ratio of 64.8%. For each year, 2003 through 2007, the \nestimated claim ratio is less than 67.5%. In the expected claims technique and the Bornhuetter-\nFerguson technique, we rely on different claim ratios for the earlier years and the latest years \nin the experience period to best reflect our expectation of expected claims for each year. In \ncontrast, the Cape Cod method requires the use of the weighted average claim ratio from all \nyears. Thus, one can distinguish the mechanical approach of developing expected claims in the \nCape Cod method from the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method in which actuarial judgment plays an \nimportant role in the development of the a priori expected claim estimate. \n                                                 \n58 Foundations of Casualty Actuarial Science, 2001.
