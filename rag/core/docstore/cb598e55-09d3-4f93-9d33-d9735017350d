ULAE, on the other \nhand, cannot be allocated to a specific claim. Examples of ULAE include salaries, rent, and \ncomputer expenses for the claims department of an insurer.  \n \nActuaries in Canada still separate LAE into ALAE and ULAE (also known as internal loss \nadjusting expense, or ILAE, in Canada). However, the NAIC promulgated two new \ncategorizations of claim adjustment expenses (effective January 1, 1998) for U.S. insurers \nreporting on Schedule P of the P&C statutory Annual Statement: defense and cost containment \n(DCC) and adjusting and other (A&O). Generally, DCC expenses include all defense litigation \nand medical cost containment expenses regardless of whether internal or external to the insurer; \nA&O expenses include all claims adjusting expenses, whether internal or external to the insurer. \n \nSome insurers in the U.S. now separately analyze DCC and A&O. Other U.S. insurers continue to \nuse the ALAE and ULAE categorization for the purpose of determining unpaid claims adjustment \nexpenses; these insurers use other allocation methods to distinguish between DCC and A&O for \nstatutory financial statement reporting purposes. In Chapter 16, we address common techniques \nfor estimating unpaid ALAE. While we choose to use the term ALAE in this chapter, we point \nout that the development methods presented in Chapter 16 can also be used for DCC.
