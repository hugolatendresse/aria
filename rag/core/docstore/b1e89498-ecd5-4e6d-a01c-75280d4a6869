Since location tends to be highly correlated with other variables (e.g., low- or high-valued \nhomes tend to be concentrated in certain areas), it is prudent to perform this analysis using multivariate \nclassification techniques.  For example, the new territorial boundaries could be modeled along with \nvarious other explanatory variables in a GLM. \nINCREASED\tLIMITS\tRATEMAKING\t\nInsurance products that provide protection against third-party liability claims usually offer the insured \ndifferent amounts of insurance coverage, referred to as limits of insurance.  Typically, the lowest level of \ninsurance offered is referred to as the basic limit, and higher limits are referred to as increased limits.   \nEstablishing appropriate rate differentials for each limit (referred to as increased limits ratemaking) is \ngrowing in importance for several reasons.  First, as personal wealth continues to grow, individuals have \nmore assets to protect and need more insurance coverage.  Second, general inflation drives up costs and, \nas discussed in Chapter 6, trends in costs have a greater impact on increased limits losses than on basic \nlimits losses.  Third, the propensity for lawsuits and the amount of jury awards have increased \nsignificantly (i.e., social inflation).  Like general inflation, this has a disproportionate impact on the \nincreased limits losses.   \nParticular lines of insurance where increased limits are of extreme importance include private passenger \nand commercial auto liability, umbrella, and any commercial product offering liability coverage such as \ncontractor\u2019s liability, professional liability, etc.  There are two types of policy limits offered:  single limits \nand compound limits.  A single limit refers to the total amount the insurer will pay for a single claim.  For \nexample, if an umbrella policy has a limit of $1,000,000, then the policy will only pay up to $1,000,000 \nfor any one claim.", "type": "Document"}}
