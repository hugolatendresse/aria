Aggregation of claims by report year can also be used to test the \nadequacy of case outstanding on known claims over time. \n \nOnce again, we highlight that the actuary must understand the systems and procedures for the \ninsurer. For some insurers, the accident date is the date that triggers coverage, which may be the \nclaim report date for some claims-made policies. For some claims-made policies, the notification \ndate rather than the report date triggers the coverage. Also, some claims-made policies have \nextended reporting endorsements that may not be coded as a new policy, and hence development \nbeyond 12 months may be possible even for annual policies. An actuary must not only determine \nhow to aggregate the data but must truly understand how the data enters and is tracked in the \ninsurer\u2019s systems. \n \n \nAdvantages of Report Year Aggregation \n \nA unique feature of report year claims data is that the number of claims is fixed at the close of the \nyear (other than for claims reported but not recorded). As a result, a report year approach will \ngenerally result in more stable data and more readily determinable development patterns than an \naccident year approach in which the number of claims is subject to change at each successive \nvaluation. The report year approach substitutes a known quantity (i.e., the number of reported \nclaim counts) for an estimate.  \n42", "type": "Document"}}
