Many jurisdictions require a company to obtain approval to change rates.  Any \ndelay in regulatory approval can lead to delays that would only exacerbate the profitability issues for \nSimple Company.   \nFavorable\tSelection\t\nAdverse selection deals with the case where a company fails to segment based on a meaningful \ncharacteristic that other companies are using, or fails to charge an appropriate differential for a rating \nvariable that other companies are charging appropriately.  Conversely, when a company identifies a \ncharacteristic that differentiates risk that other companies are not using, the company has two options for \nmaking use of this information: \n1. Implement a new rating variable. \n2. Use the characteristic for purposes outside of ratemaking (e.g., for risk selection, marketing, \nagency management). \nIf the company chooses to implement a new rating variable and prices it appropriately, its new rates will \nbe more equitable.  This may allow the company to write a segment of risks that were previously \nconsidered uninsurable.  If the company is already writing a broad spectrum of risks, then implementation \nof a new rating variable will have the opposite effect of adverse selection.  In other words, the company \nwill attract more lower-risk insureds at a profit.  Some of the higher-risk insureds will remain; those who \nremain will be written at a profit, rather than a loss.  Over the long run, the company will be better \npositioned to profitably write a broader range of risks. \nThe motorcycle insurance market provides a good example of favorable selection.  Originally, motorcycle \ninsurers used very simple rating algorithms that did not include any variation based on the age of the \noperator.  The first companies that recognized that the age of the operator is an important predictor of risk \nimplemented higher rates for youthful operators.
