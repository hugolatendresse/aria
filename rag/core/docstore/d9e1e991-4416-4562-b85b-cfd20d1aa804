We derive the adjusted \nopen claim count triangle by subtracting the adjusted closed claim count triangle from reported \nclaim counts. The adjusted reported claim triangle is then equal to: \n \n   {[(adjusted average case outstanding) x (adjusted open claim counts)] + (adjusted paid claims)} \n \nWe analyze this adjusted reported claim triangle in Exhibit III, Sheet 9. We present the \nunadjusted selected claim development factors as well as the selected claim development factors \nfrom the case outstanding only adjustment. We note that the average age-to-age factors tend to be \nbetween these two sets of selected claim development factors. In Exhibit III, Sheet 9, we select \nclaim development factors based on the three-year volume-weighted average through 72 months; \nto smooth the indications for the older maturities, we select a claim development factor of 1.00 \nfor all remaining age intervals. \n \nIn Exhibit III, Sheets 10 and 11, we project ultimate claims and derive estimates of unpaid claims, \nrespectively, based on the three Berquist-Sherman adjustments to reported and paid claims. We \nquickly see that all three projections are relatively close to one another for all accident years. In \nExhibit III, Sheets 12 and 13, we compare the results of the Berquist-Sherman projections with all \nthe other techniques presented for XYZ Insurer. In Exhibit III, Sheet 12, we compare projected \nultimate claims and in Exhibit III, Sheet 13, we compare estimated IBNR. \n \nWe observe significant differences when we compare the estimates of total unpaid claims based \non the unadjusted development technique to the unpaid claim estimates based on the development \ntechnique applied to adjusted claims data. In the following table, we summarize these estimates of \nunpaid claims. \n292", "type": "Document"}}
