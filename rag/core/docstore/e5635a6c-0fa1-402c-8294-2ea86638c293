Also, Chapter 11 outlines \nspecial classification ratemaking techniques used for certain rating variables. \nIMPORTANCE\tOF\tEQUITABLE\tRATES\t\nThe prior chapters have provided significant detail as to the techniques an actuary should use to calculate \nrates that give a reasonable expectation of achieving the target profit in total.  It may seem like the \ncompany should be satisfied as long as the rates are expected to produce the desired aggregate target \nprofit and should not, therefore, be overly concerned with individual rate equity.  In reality, a company \nthat fails to charge the right rate for individual risks when other companies are doing so may be subjected \nto adverse selection, and consequently, deteriorating financial results.  Also, a company that differentiates \nrisks using a valid risk characteristic that other companies are not using may achieve favorable selection \nand gain a competitive advantage. \nAdverse\tSelection\t\nThe goal of classification ratemaking is to determine a rate that is commensurate with the individual risk.  \nConsider the situation in which a company (e.g., Simple Company) charges an average rate for all risks \nwhen other competing companies have implemented a rating variable that varies rates to recognize the \ndifferences in expected costs.  In this case, Simple Company will attract and retain the higher-risk \ninsureds and lose the lower-risk insureds to other competing companies where lower rates are available.  \nThis results in a distributional shift toward higher-risk insureds that makes Simple Company\u2019s previously \n\u201caverage\u201d rate inadequate and causes the company to be unprofitable.  Consequently, Simple Company \nmust raise the average rate.  The increase in the average rate will encourage more lower-risk insureds to", "type": "Document"}}
