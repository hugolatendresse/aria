Reported severity, on \nthe other hand, is calculated using reported losses and reported claims.  Additionally, ALAE may be \nincluded or excluded from the numerator.  Consequently, it is important to clearly document the types of \nlosses and claims used in calculating the ratio.   \nAnalyzing changes in severity provides information about loss trends and highlights the impact of any \nchanges in claims handling procedures.     \nPure\tPremium\t(or\tLoss\tCost)\t\nPure premium (also known as loss cost or burning cost) is a measure of the average loss per exposure and \nis calculated as: \n .Severity Frequency  Exposures ofNumber \nLosses  Premium Pure \uf0b4\uf03d\uf03d                                     \nThe term pure premium is unique to insurance and most likely was derived to describe the portion of the \nrisk\u2019s expected costs that is \u201cpurely\u201d attributable to loss.   \nContinuing with the example above, if total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the number of exposures is \n2,000,000, then the pure premium is $150 (= $300,000,000 / 2,000,000 = 5.0% x $3,000).  Typically, pure \npremium is calculated using reported losses (or ultimate losses) and earned exposures.  The reported \nlosses may or may not include ALAE and/or ULAE.  As companies may choose to use other inputs \ndepending on the specific needs, it is important to document the inputs chosen.  \nChanges in pure premium highlight industry trends in overall loss costs due to changes in both frequency \nand severity.   \nAverage\tPremium\t\nThe previous ratios focused on the loss portion of the fundamental insurance equation.  However, it is \nalso very important to analyze the premium side.  A typical ratio is average premium, which is calculated \nas follows:  \n.
