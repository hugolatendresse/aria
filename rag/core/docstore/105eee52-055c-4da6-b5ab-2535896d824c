To avoid potential distortions due to \nspurious large claims, the actuary may want to consider capping claims to a predetermined value \nor excluding large claims in their entirety. In either case, the actuary will then need to add a \nprovision for large claims to the estimate of unpaid claims. \n \n \nCalculate Severities by Maturity Age and Accident Year (Complete the Square) \n \nOnce we have selected severity values at the 2008 accident year cost level, we are ready to \ncomplete the square for incremental paid severities. The top part of the square is equivalent to the \nincremental paid severity triangle. The bottom part of the square is a function of the selected \nseverities at each particular age at the 2008 cost level and the selected trend rate. To complete the \nmatrix shown on the bottom part of Exhibit V, Sheet 10, we must adjust the selected severities at \neach age to the cost level expected for each accident year. For example, for accident year 2006 at \nage 48 months, the severity of $73,056 is equal to the selected 2008 cost level severity at 48 \nmonths of $80,544 divided by 1.052. Similarly, for accident year 2002 at 96 months, the severity \nof $131,19766 is equal to the selected 2008 cost level severity of $175,816 divided by 1.056.", "type": "Document"}}
