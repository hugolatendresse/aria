(See Exhibit I, Sheet 2.) This ratio tells us the proportion of claims \nthat were paid during the development interval (i.e., age x-12 to age x) on the claims outstanding \nat the beginning of the age (i.e., age x-12). For example, the incremental paid claims for accident \nyear 1998 were $14,691,785 between the 12- and 24-month age interval (labeled 24 months in \nour development triangle). At the end of 12 months, the case outstanding for accident year 1998 \nwas $18,478,233. Thus, the incremental payment in the 12-to-24 month interval represents 79.5% \nof the case outstanding at 12 months (i.e., $14,691,785/$18,478,233). Similarly, the incremental \npaid claims for accident year 2004 between 24 and 36 months were $7,746,815. At the end of 24 \nmonths, the case outstanding for accident year 2004 was $11,150,459. Thus, the payment in the \nthis interval represents 69.5% of the case outstanding at 24 months (i.e. $7,746,815/$11,150,459) \nIn Exhibit I, Sheet 2, we present the triangle of ratios of incremental paid claims to previous case \noutstanding and calculate various averages of these ratios at each maturity. In our example, we \nselect ratios based on the simple average of the latest three years. For the ratio to ultimate, we \njudgmentally select a ratio of 1.10. In other words, we assume that 10% more than the case \noutstanding at 120 months will ultimately be paid out. \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheet 3, we calculate the ratios of the case outstanding to the previous case \noutstanding; these ratios are equal to the case outstanding at age x divided by the case outstanding \nat age x-12. For example, the case outstanding for accident year 1998 is $9,937,970 at 24 months \nand $18,478,233 at 12 months. Thus, the ratio of the case outstanding to the previous case \noutstanding at 24 months is equal to $9,937,970/$18,478,233, or 0.538. For accident year 2004,", "type": "Document"}}
