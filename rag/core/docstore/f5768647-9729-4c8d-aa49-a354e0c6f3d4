Often, it can be very difficult to get a \ncomplete copy of a competitor\u2019s rate manual.  First, companies do not file a complete manual with each \nchange, but rather file only the pages that are changing; therefore, it may take several filings to piece \ntogether a complete manual.  Additionally, companies often create underwriting tiers for which most \njurisdictions do not require companies to file the underwriting rules used to assign risks to the tiers.  Since \nit is common for the underwriting tier rules to have a significant impact on the final premium, the rating \nmanual without the underwriting rules is incomplete information.  \nEven if complete information is available, a company must take great care when relying on information \nfrom a competitor\u2019s rate filing.  Each company has different insureds, goals, expense levels, and operating \nprocedures.  If the differences are material, then the competitor information may not be relevant.  For \nexample, a personal automobile insurer specializing in writing preferred or super-preferred drivers \ntypically has different rates and rating variables than a non-standard personal automobile insurer.   In a \nmore extreme case, commercial lines products often entail discretionary pricing and underwriting rules \nthat would make accurate estimation of a competitor\u2019s final premium even more difficult.    \nOther\tThird\u2010Party\tData\t\nRatemaking analysis is often supplemented with third-party data that is not specific to insurance.  The \nmost commonly used types of third-party data are economic data and geo-demographic data, but other \nsources are relevant, too.", "type": "Document"}}
