Common distributions include lognormal, Pareto, and the truncated Pareto. \nAssuming f(x) represents a continuous distribution of losses of size x, and H is the limit being priced, then \nthe formula for the limited average severity is given by: \n\uf0f2\uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf02b\uf03d\nH\nH\nf(x)dxHxf(x)dx(H)\n0\n.LAS  \nThe severity is based on claims that are less than the limit and claims that are censored by the limit.  The \nfirst term is the loss amount for all claims less than the limit multiplied by the probability of those claims \noccurring.  The second term represents the limit multiplied by the probability that the loss exceeds the \nlimit.  The sum of the two terms equals the limited average severity.   \nThus, the increased limit factor for the limit H is represented as follows: \n.)ILF(\n0\n0\n\uf0f2\uf0f2\n\uf0f2\uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf0a5\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d B\nB\nH\nH\nf(x)dxBxf(x)dx\nf(x)dxHxf(x)dx\nH  \nThe major challenge with this approach is determining a distribution that is representative of the expected \nlosses. \nISO\tMixed\tExponential\tMethodology\t\nThe ISO Mixed Exponential Methodology is an advanced approach designed to address some of the \nissues with the empirical data (trend, censoring by policy limits, etc.).
