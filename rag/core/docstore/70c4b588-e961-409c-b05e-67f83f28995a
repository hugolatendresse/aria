For example, if the \nobserved experience varies around the true experience with a standard deviation equal to its mean, it will \nprobably receive a very low credibility.  Therefore, the majority of the rate (in this context, expected loss \nestimate) will be driven by the complement of credibility. \n  \n                                                      \n45 Theoretically when an actuary determines credibility based on the B\u00fchlmann approach, the complement \nof credibility should be the prior mean.
