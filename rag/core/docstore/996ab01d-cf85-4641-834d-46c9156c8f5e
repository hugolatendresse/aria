In this example, the method responds effectively to the change in \nclaim ratios, however it overreacts to the change in case outstanding adequacy. In our example, the \nCape Cod method significantly overstates the actual IBNR needed, indicating that the effect of \nincreasing case outstanding strength exceeds the influence of increasing claim ratios. The estimated \nclaim ratios are driven higher than their true values by the combined effects of both increasing \nclaims and greater adequacy in case outstanding. We present the detailed calculations for Scenario \n4 in the bottom section of Exhibit III, Sheets 2 and 4.  \n \n \nU.S. Auto Steady-State (No Change in Product Mix) \n \nIn the last two examples, we present projections for a combined portfolio of private passenger and \ncommercial automobile. In the top section of Exhibit IV, Sheets 1 and 2, we summarize the \ncalculations for the steady-state environment where there is no change in product mix. Similar to \nour projections using the development and expected claims techniques, we demonstrate in Exhibit \nIV, Sheet 2 that the Cape Cod technique generates the correct IBNR requirement when there is no \nchange in the product mix. \n178", "type": "Document"}}
