There was an even greater challenge in finding \nsources of data representative of the wide range of claims behavior that often exists in different \nP&C coverages. Due to limitations in readily available global data sources, we rely on claim \ndevelopment data contained in Best\u2019s Aggregates & Averages Property/Casualty United States & \nCanada \u2013 2008 Edition (Best\u2019s Aggregates & Averages)7 for many of our examples. We also rely \non actuarial colleagues at Canadian insurers who volunteered data from their organizations. This \ndata has been disguised through the use of multipliers and adjustments to protect the privacy of \nthe organizations. \n \nWhile the names of the particular coverages and the patterns inherent in the data used in our \nexamples may be unique to the U.S. or Canadian insurance environments, we believe that \nactuaries can apply the approaches, issues, and methodologies within the P&C (i.e., general or \nnon-life) insurance market of any country around the world. \n \n \nDescription of Coverages Referred to in This Book \n \nAs noted above, we refer to and use examples for U.S. and Canadian lines of insurance. To assist \nthe reader in understanding these types of coverage, we briefly describe each P&C coverage \nreferred to in the text. The insurance coverages (also referred to as lines of business) listed below \nare in alphabetical order. \n \n\uf0be Accident benefits is a Canadian no-fault automobile coverage that provides numerous benefits \nfollowing a covered accident including: medical and rehabilitation expenses, funeral benefits, \ndeath benefits, and loss of income benefits. Because this is a no-fault coverage, it is payable \nby the insured\u2019s insurer regardless of fault for the accident.", "type": "Document"}}
