Consequently, the exposure or premium needs to be adjusted to reflect any \nexpected change in exposure. \nAppendices A-F highlight some of the different approaches.  The auto and homeowners examples do not \nhave inflation-sensitive exposure bases and use internal trend data, so the coordination is straightforward.  \nHowever, the homeowners example does include a projection of the amount of insurance years, which is \nnecessary for the projection of the non-modeled catastrophe loading.   The medical malpractice loss ratio \nexample includes a net trend approach.  Trend selections are made using internal data.  The \u201cfrequency\u201d \nis actually the number of claims divided by the premium, so the frequency selection accounts for pure \nfrequency trend as well as premium trend.  The workers compensation example separately applies loss \nand exposure trend. \nOverlap\tFallacy:\t\tLoss\tDevelopment\tand\tLoss\tTrend\t\nIt may seem that trending and developing losses results in overlapping adjustments; however, this is not \nthe case.  Recall that losses in the historical experience period occurred months or years prior to the \nperiod the rates will be in effect and are not normally fully developed at the time of the analysis.  \nTrending procedures restate losses that occurred in the past to the level expected for similar losses that \nwill occur during the future period in consideration of inflation and other factors.  Loss development \nprocedures bring the immature losses to their expected ultimate level.  It is true that loss development \nincorporates inflationary pressures that cause payments for reported claims to increase in the time after \nreporting, but this does not prove an overlap either.  The timeline below provides a graphical illustration \nof how losses are trended and developed. \n \nIn this example, the historical experience period is Calendar-Accident Year 2010.
