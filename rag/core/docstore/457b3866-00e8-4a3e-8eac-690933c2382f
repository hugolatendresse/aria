Unpaid ULAE is then \ncalculated according to the formulas previously presented: \n  \nUnpaid ULAE = W* x {L \u2013 [(U1 x R) + (U2 x P)]}, which can be expressed as \n \nUnpaid ULAE = W* x [U1 x (L \u2013 R) + U2 x (L \u2013 P)} \n \n \nPractical Difficulties with the Generalized Approach \n \nThe generalized approach is consistent with the assumption that the claims adjusting activities \nassociated with reopening and reclosing a claim have no cost. An alternative approach is to \nassume that the ultimate cost of closed claims C equals the sum of total amounts paid on \nclosed claims as of the evaluation date. Under this approach, the cost of reclosing a claim is \nassumed to be equal to the cost of closing a claim of the same size. However, this alternative \napproach still fails to capture the cost of reopening claims. \n \nIn cases where reopenings of claims are more than negligible, and the ULAE cost of such \nreopenings (and subsequent reclosings) is not immaterial, the actuary could obtain a separate \nprovision for the cost of future claims handling activities related to claims that are closed as of \nthe evaluation of unpaid ULAE. Conger and Nolibos suggest that this provision could perhaps \nbe based on a study of the frequency of reopenings and average cost in ULAE of handling the \nreopened claims. \n \nAs noted previously, the estimation of R and C, the ultimate cost of reported and closed \nclaims, may not be trivial. Conger and Nolibos state that they have not attempted to measure \nthe relative accuracy of the generalized method (as compared to other dollar-based methods) \nin an inflationary environment. They also identify two other issues that warrant further \ninvestigation: the effect of reopened claims on the accuracy of the estimates of unpaid ULAE, \nand how to modify the approach to properly reflect the change over time in the quantity or", "type": "Document"}}
