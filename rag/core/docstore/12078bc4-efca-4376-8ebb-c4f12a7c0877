Case outstanding at 24 months (i.e., valuation date December 31, 2007) is equal \nto the sum of case outstanding on all three accident year 2006 claims ($0 + $500 + 420). The final \nvalue in the triangle for accident year 2006 is at 36 months (i.e., valuation date December 31, \n2008). Claim IDs 6 and 7 have ending case outstanding values of $270 and $650, respectively. \nThus, total case outstanding for accident year 2006 at 36 months is $920. \n \nYou can continue in a similar manner to build the remainder of the case outstanding development \ntriangle.  \n \n \nReported Claim Development Triangle \n \nWe define reported claims to be equal to cumulative paid claims through the valuation date plus \ncase outstanding at the valuation date. Thus, we are able to build the reported claim development \ntriangle by adding the cumulative paid claim triangle to the case outstanding triangle. Table 11 \nbelow presents the reported claim triangle for our sample 15 claims.  \n \nTable 11 \u2013 Reported Claim Development Triangle \nAccident Reported Claims as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 \n2005 1,500 2,420 2,720 3,020 \n2006 1,150 1,840 2,070  \n2007 1,650 2,640   \n2008 1,740    \n \nIt is interesting to return to the original data and observe what happened to accident year 2005 \nclaims over time. Claim ID 1 occurred early in 2005 and was reported shortly thereafter. Through \nDecember 31, 2005 (i.e., the first year of development), there were $400 in claim payments and \nthe insurer established a case outstanding of $200. In the following year, this claim settled for \nslightly more than the case outstanding value. A claim payment of $220 was made during 2006 \nand the case outstanding was reduced to $0.
