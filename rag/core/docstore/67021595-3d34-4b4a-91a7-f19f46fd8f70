For \nRefined Company, the premium charged varies by each level of the rating variable and is equitable.  For \nSimple Company, the premium charged is too little for the H risks.  There is a shortfall of $1,250,000, \nwhich is completely offset by the excess premium collected from L risks.  In other words, the L risks are \nsubsidizing the H risks at Simple Company. \n \nGiven the assumption that 1 out of 10 insureds shops at renewal and makes the purchase decision based \non price, the distribution will not remain static.  The H risks who shop will choose Simple Company, and \nthe L risks who shop will choose Refined Company.  This movement results in the following distribution \nof risks for policy year one: \n \n9.1 Original Distrib ution, Loss Cost, and  Rates\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nRisk\nIns ured \nRisks\nCharged \nRate\nIns ured \nRisks\nCharged \nRate\nH2 3 0 . 0 0$         25,000             230.00 $        25,000             180.00 $       \nL1 3 0 . 0 0$         25,000             130.00 $        25,000             180.00 $       \nTotal 180.00$         50,000             180.00 $        50,000             180.00 $       \nTrue \nExpe c te d \nCost\nRefined Company Simple Company\n9.2 Static Distrib ution With Results\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\nRisk\nIns ured \nRisks\nCharged \nRate\nTotal \n$E xcess/ \n($Shortfall)\nIns ured \nRisks\nCharged \nRate\nTotal \n$E xcess/ \n($Shortfall)\nH2 3 0 . 0 0$         25,000             230.00 $        - $                25,000         180.00 $         (1,250,000)$    \nL1 3 0 . 0 0$         25,000             130.00 $        - $                25,000         180.00 $         1,250,000$", "type": "Document"}}
