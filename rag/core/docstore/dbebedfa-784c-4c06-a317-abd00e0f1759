Furthermore, the assumption that 50% of ULAE payments are \nsustained when a claim is opened and the remaining 50% when a claim is closed may not \naccurately describe an insurer\u2019s application of resources to the various stages in the life cycle of \nits claims.  \n \nIt is also important to recognize that the classical technique can lead to inaccurate results \nwhenever the volume of claims is growing. Donald Mango and Craig Allen expand on this point \nin their paper \u201cTwo Alternative Methods for Calculating the Unallocated Loss Adjustment \nExpense Reserve.\u201d95 They note that the numerator in the ratio (i.e., calendar year paid ULAE) \ntends to react relatively quickly to an increase in exposure or an increase in the number of claims \nbeing reported. However, the denominator (i.e., paid claims) reflects claim payments made on \nclaims that were reported at the former, lower, exposure base and will not be as responsive to the \ngrowth in volume. Thus, the resulting paid ULAE-to-paid claims ratio may misrepresent the true \nsituation. A similar mismatch between paid ULAE and paid claims can occur if the volume is \ndecreasing.  \n \n                                                 \n93 CAS Discussion Paper Program, May 1988. \n94 CAS Forum, Summer 1996. \n95 CAS Forum, Fall 1999. \n390", "type": "Document"}}
