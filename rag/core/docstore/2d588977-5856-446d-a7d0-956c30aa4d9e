Mango and Craig A. Allen discuss a variation of the Kittel refinement to the classical \ntechnique in their 1999 paper.104 They specifically suggest a possible variation on the application \nof the formula when the actuary is working with a line of business where the actual historical \ncalendar period claims are volatile, perhaps due to the random timing associated with the \nreporting or settlement of large claims. In this case, Mango and Allen suggest replacing the actual \ncalendar period claims with expected claims for those historical calendar periods. They explain \nthat the actuary can estimate the expected paid claims by applying selected reporting and payment \npatterns to a set of accident year estimated ultimate claims. This type of adjustment would be \nmost useful for lines of business with a relatively small number of claims of widely varying sizes. \n \n \n                                                 \n104 CAS Forum, Fall 1999. \n400", "type": "Document"}}
