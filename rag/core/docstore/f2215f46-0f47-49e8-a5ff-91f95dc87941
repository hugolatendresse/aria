In regards to premium aggregation, there are only two methods applicable:  \ncalendar year and policy year.  Report year is a loss concept only. \nCalendar Year Aggregation and Accident Year Aggregation consider all premium transactions that \noccur during the twelve-month calendar year without regard to the date of policy issuance; calendar year \nand accident year premium are typically equivalent and the text will use the term calendar year \npremium.11  At the end of the calendar year, the calendar year premium is fixed.  Since calendar year \nconsiders any transactions that occurred on or after the first day of the year, but on or before the last day \nof the year, calendar years are represented graphically as squares, as shown in Figure 5.3.    \n                                                      \n11 There are some limited cases when the calendar and accident year premium will not be equivalent.  This will be \ndiscussed in the Premium Development section later in this chapter. \n5.1 Policies\nPolicy\nEffective \nDate\nExpiration \nDate Premium\nA1 0 / 0 1 / 1 0 0 9 / 3 0 / 1 1 $ 2 0 0\nB0 1 / 0 1 / 1 1 1 2 / 3 1 / 1 1 $ 2 5 0\nC0 4 / 0 1 / 1 1 0 3 / 3 1 / 1 2 $ 3 0 0\nD0 7 / 0 1 / 1 1 0 6 / 3 0 / 1 2 $ 4 0 0\nE1 0 / 0 1 / 1 1 0 9 / 3 0 / 1 2 $ 3 5 0\nF0 1 / 0 1 / 1 2 1 2 / 3 1 / 1 2 $ 2 2 5\n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D E F\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n5.2 Example Policies", "type": "Document"}}
