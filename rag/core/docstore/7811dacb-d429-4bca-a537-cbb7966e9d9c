Actuaries study the pattern of premium development, \nwhich can depend on several factors including: \n\uf0b7 The type of plan permitted by the jurisdiction or offered by the carrier \n\uf0b7 The stability of the historical relationship between the original premium estimate and the final \naudited premium \n\uf0b7 Internal company operations (auditing procedures, marketing strategy, accounting policy, etc.). \nCalendar year data is final at the end of the calendar year, whereas accident year and policy year data may \nstill be developing.  Thus, premium development factors to adjust for premium audits are necessary to \ndetermine the ultimate premium when analyzing policy year or accident year data.   \nConsider the policy year example below. \n\uf0b7 A workers compensation carrier writes one policy per month in 2011. \n\uf0b7 Estimated premium for each policy is booked at policy inception for $500,000. \n\uf0b7 Premium on every policy develops upward by 8% at the first audit, six months after the policy \nexpires. \nAt December 31, 2012, the six policies written in the first half of 2011 have completed their audits, but \nthe six policies written in the second half of the year have not.  The Policy Year 2011 premium as of \nDecember 31, 2012, is: \n$6,240,000 = 6 x $500,000 x 1.08 + 6 x $500,000. \nAt December 31, 2013, all twelve policies have completed their final audits so the final premium is: \n$6,480,000 = 12 x $500,000 x 1.08. \nFrom December 31, 2012, (24 months after the start of the policy year) to December 31, 2013, (36 \nmonths after the start of the policy year), the premium development factor is  \n1.0385 (= $6.48 million / $6.24 million).   \nIf this 24-36 month development pattern is relatively stable across other policy years, the actuary will feel \nconfident adjusting future policy year premium at 24 months of development by this factor to bring the \npremium to its ultimate value.", "type": "Document"}}
