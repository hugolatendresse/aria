They developed a \nmodel which illustrates the two influences underlying claim development: the reporting pattern of \nclaims over time and the changing characteristics of the size of claims distribution at successive \nmaturities. Pinto and Gogol noted that without the latter influence, the development factors for \nclaims in excess of different retentions would be identical. They conclude their paper as follows: \n \nThe results that have been produced indicate clearly that loss and ALAE \ndevelopment varies significantly by retention. Accordingly, pricing and reserving \nestimates incorporating development factors may be substantially in error if this \nis not taken into account. As this applies to paid as well as reported loss \ndevelopment, recognition of retention is also a major factor in estimating \ndiscounted losses using paid development factors. \n \n \nWhen the Development Technique Works and When it Does Not  \n \nThe development technique is based on the premise that we can predict future claims activity for \nan accident year (or policy year, report year, etc.) based on historical claims activity to date for \nthat accident year. The primary assumption of this technique is that the reporting and payment of \nfuture claims will be similar to the patterns observed in the past.
