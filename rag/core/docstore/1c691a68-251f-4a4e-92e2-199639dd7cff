Many factors can have an effect on the reporting and closing of claims. For example, a \nlarge catastrophic storm, such as a hurricane, has the potential to temporarily limit an insurer\u2019s \noperations with telephone and computer system shutdowns. In such a situation, there may be a \none-time blip with a decrease in the ratio of closed-to-reported claim counts.
