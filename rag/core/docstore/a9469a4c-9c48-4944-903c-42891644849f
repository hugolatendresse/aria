Since the goal is to determine the \nlosses eliminated when changing from a $250 to a $500 deductible, the analysis can only use policies \nwith deductibles of $250 or less.  Columns 4 and 5 contain the net reported losses in Column 3 restated to \n$500 and $250 deductible levels, respectively.39  The losses eliminated by moving from a $250 to a $500 \ndeductible are the difference between the two columns.  The LER equals the eliminated losses divided by \nthe total losses at the $250 level.   \n \nThe same comments made earlier with respect to trend and development in the Increased Limit Factors \nsection apply to deductible pricing, too. \n                                                      \n39 Columns 4 and 5 are not simply Column 3 minus the product of Column 2 and the assumed deductible.  This is \nbecause not every reported loss exceeds the assumed deductible.
