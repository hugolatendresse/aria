We remind you that there is a mismatch in \nthe average paid claim triangle since the numerator (cumulative paid claims) includes partial \nclaim payments and the denominator (closed claim counts) represents only claims with final \nsettlement. We must consider this limitation when drawing any conclusions from this particular \ndiagnostic triangle. \n \nTable 13 \u2013 Average Paid Claim Development Triangle \nAccident Average Paid Claims as of (months) \nYear 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 \n2002 11,417 13,067 16,436 20,290 24,073 27,752 29,178 \n2003 9,631 10,163 13,478 18,125 22,896 25,077  \n2004 9,452 11,673 17,996 23,455 26,028   \n2005 10,315 10,920 16,270 20,569    \n2006 11,502 13,000 19,000     \n2007 10,726 15,000      \n2008 12,351       \n \nIn this diagnostic triangle, we observe that the average values along the latest diagonal are \ngenerally the highest value in each column (particularly at 12 to 36 months).
