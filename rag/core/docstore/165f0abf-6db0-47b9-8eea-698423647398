The entry for \nL(2012,2) represents a claim that is reported in 2012 after a report lag of two years (i.e., the claim \noccurred in 2010).  More generally, each row corresponds to claims reported in a given year (i.e., the \nreport year), each column corresponds to claims that share the same reporting lag, and each diagonal (top \nleft to bottom right) represents claims that occurred in the same year (i.e., the same accident year).  Since \noccurrence policies provide compensation for claims that occur during the policy period regardless of \nwhen the claim is reported, they are aggregated by accident year (i.e., each diagonal in the table). \nFor example, an annual occurrence policy written on January 1, 2010, covers claims that are incurred \nduring the policy period but may be reported during the policy period or subsequent to the policy period.  \nStated in a different way, the occurrence policy covers claims reported in 2010 with no report lag, claims \nreported in 2011 with a one-year report lag, claims reported in 2012 with a two-year report lag, and so on: \nL(2014,4)L(2013,3)L(2012,2)L(2011,1)L(2010,0)(2010)Policy   Occurrence \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  \nAssuming a maximum report lag of N, the occurrence policy for year Y can be written more generally: \n.Policy   Occurrence \n0\n\uf0e5 \uf02b\uf03d\nN\ni-\ni,i)L(Y(Y)  \nSince the coverage trigger for the claims-made policy is the report date, a claims-made policy is \nrepresented by the entries in a row.  For example, a claims-made policy written on January 1, 2010, \ncovers all claims reported in 2010 regardless of the report lag:", "type": "Document"}}
