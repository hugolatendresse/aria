For example, \ncommissions may be 10% of premium.  The historical expense ratios and other information are used to \nselect a percentage that is to apply to the premium from policies written during the time the rates will be \nin effect.  Thus, the variable expenses will automatically change as the premium changes, so there is no \nneed to trend the variable expense ratio.  \nFixed expenses, on the other hand, are assumed to be a constant dollar amount (i.e., an average fixed \nexpense per exposure or policy).  There is an expectation that the average fixed expenses will increase \nover time due to inflationary pressures.    \nIn the Premium-based Projection Method, the fixed expense ratio is the fixed expenses divided by \npremium.  Approaches for trending expenses vary by company.  If the average fixed expenses and \naverage premium are changing at the same rate, then the fixed expense ratio will be consistent and no \ntrending is necessary.  However, some companies trend the fixed expense ratio, which implies that \naverage fixed expenses are changing at a different rate than average premium.  For the purpose of this \ntext, the fixed expense provision calculated using that methodology is not trended.   \nIn the Exposure/Policy-based Projection Method, the total fixed expenses are divided by the \nexposures/policies to calculate the average fixed expense.  If an inflation-sensitive exposure base (e.g., \npayroll per $100) is used, then no trending is necessary if the expenses and exposure base are changing at \nthe same rate.  If a non-inflation sensitive base (e.g., car-year or house-year) or policy counts are used, the \nexpectation is that the average fixed expense figure will change over time and trending is appropriate.", "type": "Document"}}
