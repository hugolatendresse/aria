Thus, a key assumption of the \ndevelopment technique is also applicable to this type of frequency-severity analysis. Recall that \nthe underlying assumption in the development technique is that claims reported (or paid) to date \nwill continue to develop in a similar manner in the future. In a frequency-severity method where \nreported (or closed) claim counts are used to project the ultimate number of claims, the actuary \nassumes that the claim counts reported (or closed) to date will continue to develop in a similar \nmanner in the future. Similarly, the actuary using the development technique on severities \nassumes that the relative change in a given year\u2019s severities from one evaluation point to the next \nis similar to the relative change in prior years\u2019 severities at similar evaluation points. \n \n \nMechanics of the Technique \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheets 1 through 8, we present our first frequency-severity example for Auto \nCollision Insurer. This first example has four basic steps: \n \n\uf0be Project and select ultimate claim counts \n\uf0be Project ultimate severity \n\uf0be Project ultimate claims \n\uf0be Develop unpaid claim estimate \n \nIn this example, we use semi-annual accident periods and valuations in intervals of six months.61 \n \n \nProject and Select Ultimate Claim Counts  \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheets 1 through 3, we use the development technique to project both closed and \nreported claim counts to an ultimate basis. (We describe the development technique in detail in \nChapter 7 \u2013 Development Technique.) For Auto Collision Insurer, the closed claim counts \ninclude claim counts closed with payments or claim-related expense payments or both, but do not \ninclude claim counts closed with no payment (CNP).
