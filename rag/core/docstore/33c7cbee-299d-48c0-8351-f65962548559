Using the projected ultimate \nclaims, we then calculate the estimate of unpaid claims for IBNR and the total unpaid claim \nestimate (i.e., the sum of IBNR and case outstanding). We believe that the projected ultimate \nclaims are valuable for the purpose of evaluating and selecting the final unpaid claim estimate \nand for determining the accuracy of the prior estimate of unpaid claims. We address the \nevaluation of numerous estimation techniques in detail in the last chapter of Part 3.  \n \n \nClaim-Related Expenses \n \nIn this text, we use the terms claim adjustment expenses and claim-related expenses to refer to \ntotal claim adjustment expenses (i.e., the sum of ALAE and ULAE, or the sum of DCC and \n                                                 \n9 Some accounting approaches estimate ultimate claims on a policy year basis in a manner that includes \nlosses yet to be incurred.
