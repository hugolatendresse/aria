Because Simple Company\u2019s \ndistribution has shifted toward more H risks, the excess premium from the L risks fails to make up for the \nshortfall from the H risks; therefore, Simple Company loses money in policy year one.  In order to correct \nfor the $250,000 shortfall, Simple Company is forced to increase the rate from $180 to $185, the new \naverage cost based on the new distribution. \nUnless Simple Company segments its portfolio in a more refined manner, this cycle will continue each \nyear.  More specifically, the H risks will continue to shift to Simple Company, and the L risks will \ncontinue to shift toward Refined Company.  Since Refined Company is charging equitable rates, there \nwill be no excess or shortfall.  Conversely, Simple Company continues to charge an average rate based on \nthe prior distribution, and there will be a shortfall each year as the distribution changes.  Thus, Simple \nCompany will need to keep taking rate increases.  By policy year five, the results will be as follows: \n \nThis trend will continue until such time that Simple Company begins to segment in a more refined \nmanner, loses too much money to continue, or only insures H risks at the rate of $230.  Since Refined \nCompany maintains a rate appropriate for both H and L risks, they are able to write both types of risk \ncompetitively and profitably.    \nNote that this was a very simple example with simple assumptions intended to demonstrate the adverse \nselection cycle.  In reality, there are many factors that will affect the adverse selection cycle.
