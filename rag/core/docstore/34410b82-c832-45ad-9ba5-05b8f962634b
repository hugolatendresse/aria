For illustrative purposes, assume a law change mandates a rate decrease of 5% on \nJuly 1, 2011, that is applicable to all policies, including policies currently in-force.  Assuming annual \npolicies and the standard rate changes laid out earlier, the pictorial representation is as follows: \n \nNotice that the vertical line splits rate level groups 2 and 3 into two pieces each.  Applying standard \ngeometry, the areas for this example are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Area 1 in CY 2011:    0.125 = 0.50 x 0.50 x 0.50  \n\uf0b7 Area 2a in CY 2011:  0.250 = 0.50 - 0.125 - 0.125 \n\uf0b7 Area 2b in CY 2011:  0.125 = 0.50 x 0.50 x 0.50  \n\uf0b7 Area 3a in CY 2011:  0.125 = 0.50 x 0.50 x 0.50  \n\uf0b7 Area 3b in CY 2011:  0.375 = 0.50 - 0.125 \n \nThe rate level indices are also affected by the inclusion of the -5% law change which impacts the rate \nlevel indices associated with the portion of areas 2b, 3b, and 4.  The cumulative rate level indices \nassociated with each group are as follows: \n \nThe on-level factor is still the current cumulative rate level index divided by the average cumulative rate \nlevel index of the historical period.  For the example, the calculation is as follows: \n.375.00973.1125.01550.1125.09975.00.2501.05000.1251.0000\n1.0863  1.0171 \uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d  \n50%\n0%\n100%\n% of Policy \nEarned\n5.22 Rate and Law Change assuming CY EP with Annual Policies\n2010 2011 2012\n1 2a 3b 4\n7/1/10 \n5% Change\n1/1/11 \n10% \nChange\n4/1/12 \n-1% Cha nge\n2013\n7/1/11 \n-5%  Law \nChange\n2b\n3a\n5.23 Step 3 with Benefit Change\nRate Level \nGroup\nCumulative Rate \nLevel Index\n11 . 0 0 0 0\n2a 1.0500\n2b 0.9975\n3a 1.1550\n3b 1.0973\n41 . 0 8 6 3", "type": "Document"}}
