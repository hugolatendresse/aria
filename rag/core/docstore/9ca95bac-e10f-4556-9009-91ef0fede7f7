Second, insurers were instituting data warehouse initiatives that greatly \nimproved the granularity and accessibility of data that could be analyzed for ratemaking purposes.  So \ndespite the fact that sophisticated statistical techniques existed much earlier than this, it was the \ncircumstances of enhanced computing power and better data that enabled their usage in classification \nratemaking.  A final and perhaps the most important trigger in the widespread adoption of multivariate \nmethods was competitive pressure.  As explained in the last chapter, when one or more companies \nimplement improved classification ratemaking, they gain a competitive advantage and put the rest of the \nindustry in a position of adverse selection and decreased profitability.  This occurred in the U.K. personal \nlines markets in the 1990s and in the U.S. personal auto markets in the early 2000s. \nTHE\tBENEFITS\tOF\tMULTIVARIATE\tMETHODS\t\nThe main benefit of multivariate methods is that they consider all rating variables simultaneously and \nautomatically adjust for exposure correlations between rating variables, which should now be understood \nas the primary shortcoming of univariate approaches.  Later in this chapter a graphical example (Figure \n10.1) shows a disparity in results between the univariate method and a particular multivariate method, \nwhen rating variables are correlated. \nSecondly, multivariate methods attempt to remove unsystematic effects in the data (also known as noise) \nand capture only the systematic effects (also known as signal) as much as possible.  This is not the case \nwith univariate methods, which include both signal and noise in the results.", "type": "Document"}}
