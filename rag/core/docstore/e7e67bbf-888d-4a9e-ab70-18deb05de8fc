Over time, insurance companies introduced deductible clauses in which the insured is \nresponsible for the first dollars of loss up to the deductible amount, and the insurer pays the amount \ngreater than the deductible, up to applicable policy limits.   \nThere are two basic types of deductibles:  flat dollar deductibles and percentage deductibles. 38   Flat \ndollar deductibles are the most prevalent.  As the name suggest, a flat dollar deductible (e.g., $250 \ndeductible) specifies a dollar amount below which losses are not covered by the policy.  Flat dollar \ndeductibles may range from very small amounts (e.g., $100 or $250) on personal lines policies to very \nlarge deductibles (e.g., $100,000 or more) on large commercial policies.  Percentage deductibles state the \ndeductible as a percentage of the coverage amount.  For example, a 5% deductible on a home insured for \n$500,000 is equivalent to a flat dollar deductible of $25,000.  These types of deductibles are most \nprevalent on property policies, and are often applied specifically to perils that are susceptible to \ncatastrophic losses (e.g. earthquake or hurricane).     \nThere are several reasons why deductibles are popular among both insureds and insurers, some of which \nare listed below: \n\uf0b7 Premium reduction:  The application of a deductible reduces the rate as the insured is \nresponsible for a portion of the losses.  Often the insured (whether an individual or company) \nmay be willing to cover the amount under the deductible in exchange for a lower premium. \n\uf0b7 Eliminates small nuisance claims:  Under a full coverage policy, insureds have an incentive to \nfile every claim.  Insurance companies incur loss adjustment expenses in the process of settling \nreported claims.  The expense associated with investigating and handling small claims frequently", "type": "Document"}}
