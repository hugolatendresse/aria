But what are unpaid claim estimates and where do they come from? Claim and \nclaim adjustment expense reserves (as reported on an insurer\u2019s financial statements) represent an \ninsurer\u2019s liability for unpaid claims as of a particular point in time. Both claims professionals and \nactuaries have responsibilities related to the unpaid claim estimate of an insurer. As previously \nnoted, there are five elements comprising the total unpaid claim estimate: \n \n\uf0be Case outstanding \n\uf0be Provision for future development on known claims \n\uf0be Estimate for reopened claims  \n\uf0be Provision for claims incurred but not reported  \n\uf0be Provision for claims in transit (incurred and reported but not recorded) \n \nClaims professionals are responsible for estimating case outstanding on claims that are reported \nto the insurer; these estimates are also known as \u201cunpaid case\u201d and \u201ccase estimates.\u201d According \nto consolidated claim development data for the U.S. insurance industry as a whole, unpaid case, \nnet of reinsurance, represent less than 50% of total unpaid claims and claim expenses.10 (The \nproportion of unpaid case to total unpaid claims varies tremendously by line of business and from \ninsurer to insurer.) While claims professionals typically estimate case outstanding, actuaries are \nresponsible for estimating the remaining components of total unpaid claims.  \n \nIn this chapter, we focus on the unpaid claim estimate from the perspective of the claims \nprofessional. As we will see in later chapters, actuaries rely on the historical variations in the case \noutstanding generated by claims professionals as a base for determining the remaining \ncomponents of total unpaid claims. Therefore, it is important for the actuary to understand the", "type": "Document"}}
