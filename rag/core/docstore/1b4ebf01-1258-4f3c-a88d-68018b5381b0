Variable expenses vary directly with premium; in other words, the expense is a constant \npercentage of the premium.  Premium taxes and commissions are two examples of variable expenses.  In \nthe past, no distinction was recognized between fixed and variable expenses, and actuaries estimated all \nunderwriting expenses in the same way.  More recently, techniques have been developed to estimate fixed \nand variable expenses separately in cases where both types of expenses are material.   \nThe magnitude and distribution of underwriting expenses vary significantly for different lines of business.  \nFor example, commissions tend to be much higher in lines that require a comprehensive inspection at the \nonset of the policy (e.g., large commercial property) than for lines that do not involve such activity (e.g., \npersonal automobile).  The expenses can even vary significantly by company within a given line of \nbusiness.  For example, a national direct writer may incur significant other acquisition costs for \nadvertising.  In contrast, an agency-based company may rely more heavily on the agents to generate new \nbusiness; consequently, the other acquisition costs will be lower, but this will be at least partially offset by \nhigher commission expenses.   \nThe next sections outline three different procedures used to derive expense provisions for ratemaking:   \n\uf0b7 All Variable Expense Method \n\uf0b7 Premium-based Projection Method \n\uf0b7 Exposure/Policy-based Projection Method \nALL\tVARIABLE\tEXPENSE\tMETHOD\t\nIn the past, actuaries used the All Variable Expense Method, which does not differentiate between fixed \nand variable underwriting expenses and treats all expenses as variable (i.e., all expenses are assumed to be \na constant percentage of premium).  More specifically, this method assumes that expense ratios during the \nprojected period will be consistent with the historical expense ratios (i.e., all historical underwriting", "type": "Document"}}
