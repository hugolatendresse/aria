In such cases, it is possible to make an adjustment to the pure premium approach to minimize \nthe impact of any distributional bias.   \nAs discussed in the previous section, using premium in the loss ratio approach helps adjust for the \ndistributional bias that distorts the pure premium approach.  To make the results of the two approaches \nmore consistent, the pure premium approach can be performed using exposures adjusted by the exposure-\nweighted average relativity of all other variables.   \nThe following table shows the calculation of the current exposure-weighted average amount of insurance \nrelativities by territory. \n9.13 Weighted AOI Relativity\nAOI 1 2 3\nLow 0.8000       7                130           143            \nMedium 1.0000       108            126            126            \nHigh 1.3500       179            129            40              \nTotal 294            385            309            \nWtd Avg AOI Relativity by Terr 1.2083    1.0497     0.9528      \nExposures by TerritoryCharged \nAOI \nFactor\n \nIf there are multiple rating variables, then the table above needs to be expanded so that the exposure-\nweighted average relativity is based on all rating variables.
