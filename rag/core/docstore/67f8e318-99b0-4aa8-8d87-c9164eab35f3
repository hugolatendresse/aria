Examples of such losses, also referred to as shock losses, may include a large multi-claimant \nliability claim, a total loss on an exceptionally high-valued home, and a total permanent disability of a \nyoung worker.  For many large companies, the size of the portfolio can dwarf the effects of shock losses, \nbut shock losses in a smaller portfolio can introduce instability to the ratemaking process.   \nIf actual shock losses are included in the ratemaking analysis as is, indicated rates may increase \nimmediately after a year with shock losses and may decrease when there are no shock losses present in \nthe experience period.  Consequently, historical data used to project future losses may exclude these \nlosses in their entirety or, more typically, may just exclude the portion above some predetermined \nthreshold.  Losses are later modified by a provision to incorporate expected shock losses based on a long-\nterm view.  \nIn some cases, the threshold for capping shock losses may be based on the minimum amount of insurance \noffered, often called the \u201cbasic limit\u201d as it corresponds to the limit associated with the base rate.  When \nthis approach is used, the rate level indication (which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8) is the rate \nlevel need assuming all insureds choose the basic limit.  Consequently, the premium used in the rate level \nindication17 must also be adjusted to the basic limit (i.e., each exposure\u2019s premium rerated as if the basic \nlimit was purchased).  The effect of the losses other than the basic limit will be considered in the", "type": "Document"}}
