Data \nis also required by regulators.  In the U.S., property and casualty insurance is regulated at the state level, \nand regulators frequently require companies to file statistical data in a consistent format.  Normally, state \nregulators do not need detailed data for their purposes and the required statistical plan is a summary-based \nplan.     \nOne example of a statistical plan is The Texas Private Passenger Automobile Statistical Plan, as \npromulgated by the Texas Commissioner of Insurance.  For many years, Texas used a benchmark rate \nsystem for setting personal automobile premium.  The state set benchmark rates from which companies \ncould deviate.  The benchmark rates were determined based on an analysis of statistical data provided by \ninsurance companies writing personal automobile insurance in Texas.  Texas required statistical data that \nwas aggregated by territory, deductible, and driver class.  In addition to being used as the basis for setting \nthe benchmark rates, the data was publicly available and was used by companies to supplement internal \nanalyses. \nTo comply with various states\u2019 requirements for aggregated industry data as well as for the industry\u2019s \nneeds for aggregated data, certain industry service organizations have been formed to collect and \naggregate data from a group of participating companies writing the same insurance product.  For example, \nthe National Council for Compensation Insurance (NCCI) and Insurance Services Office, Inc (ISO) are \ntwo such organizations that meet the U.S. industry\u2019s need for aggregated data.  In addition to collecting \nand summarizing data, these organizations analyze the aggregated data and make the results of the \nanalysis available to the participating companies.  Alternatively, the participating companies may be able \nto request the aggregated data to perform their own independent analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
