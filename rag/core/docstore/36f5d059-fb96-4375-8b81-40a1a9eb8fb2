If the cost outweighs the benefit, then it may not be wise \nto pursue the change unless there are additional intangible benefits that could not be quantified.   \nThe following is an example of a very simple cost-benefit analysis.  Assume a ratemaking analysis \nidentifies that a risk characteristic accounts for a 10% difference in projected ultimate losses and expenses \nbetween Class A and Class B.  The characteristic is not currently reflected in the rates; consequently, both \nclasses are charged a rate of $1,050.  (Note that this average rate reflects a target profit provision of \n5.2%.)  Using the current average rate, Class A risks will be more profitable than Class B risks.  \nTable 13.1 depicts the number of risks for each class, as well as the projected costs, current rates, and \nachieved profit for each class.", "type": "Document"}}
