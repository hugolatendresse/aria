These ratios are used directly in the \ncalculation of the overall rate level indications as presented in Chapter 8.  The definitions provided below \nassume that LAE are included with losses in the rate level indication formula.   \nThe variable permissible loss ratio is calculated as follows: \n.01 %Profit Target   - % Expense  Variable - 1.0  VPLR T - V- Q. \uf03d\uf03d  \nThis can be thought of as the percentage of each premium dollar that is intended to pay for the projected \nloss and LAE and projected fixed expenses.  The remaining portion of each premium dollar is intended to \npay for variable expenses and for profit for the company.  \nThe total permissible loss ratio is calculated as follows: \n. - F-V- Q. T01 %Profit Target   - % Expense  Total - 1.0  PLR \uf03d\uf03d  \nThis can be thought of as the percentage of each premium dollar that is intended to pay for the projected \nloss and LAE.  The remaining portion of each premium dollar is intended to pay for all underwriting \nexpenses and for profit for the company.   \nIf all expenses are treated as variable expenses, the VPLR and PLR are the same. If LAE are not included \nwith historical losses (but maybe included with underwriting expenses) in the rate level indication \nformula, the definition of VPLR and PLR must be adjusted.  An example of this is provided in \nAppendix C. \nSUMMARY\t\nThe rate an insurance company charges must be adequate to cover all costs associated with the insurance \npolicy.  These costs include underwriting expenses (i.e., general expenses, other acquisition, commissions \nand brokerage, and taxes, license, and fees).  Some of these expenses vary directly with premium and are \ncalled variable expenses; other expenses are assumed to be the same for each risk (i.e., exposure or \npolicy) and are called fixed expenses.", "type": "Document"}}
