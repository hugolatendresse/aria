Thus, this is represented graphically using a parallelogram \nstarting with a policy written on the first day of the policy year and ending with a policy written on the \nlast day of the policy year:   \n \nAs demonstrated in the graph, the policy year takes significantly longer to close.  For that reason, most \nratemaking analysis focuses on calendar year exposures. \nIn addition to aggregating by calendar or policy year, exposures can be defined in four basic ways:  \nwritten, earned, unearned, and in-force exposures. \nWritten exposures  a r e  t h e  t o t a l  e x p o s u r e s  a r i s i n g  f r o m  p olicies issued (i.e., underwritten or, more \ninformally, written) during a specified period of time, such as a calendar quarter or a calendar year.  For \nexample, the written exposure for Calendar Year 2011 is the sum of the exposures for all policies that had \nan effective date in 2011.  As can be seen in Figure 4.6, Policies B, C, D and E all have effective dates \n(shown as large circles on the horizontal axis) in 20 11, and their entire exposure contributes to Calendar \nYear 2011 written exposure.  In contrast, Policies A a nd F have effective dates in years 2010 and 2012, \nrespectively, and do not contribute to Calendar Year 2011 written exposure. \n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D EF\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n4.4 Calendar Year Aggregation\nCY 10 CY 11 CY 12\n1/1/10 1/1/11 1/1/12 1/1/13\n50%\n0%\n100%\nAB C D E F\n% of Policy \nTerm E xpired\n4.5 Policy Year Aggregation\nPY 10 PY 11 PY 12", "type": "Document"}}
