In our example, the initial case outstanding recorded on the report date of the claim \nis $15,000. This amount varies over the life of the claim; just before the claim initially closes in \nMarch 2010, the case outstanding is $30,000. When the claim is reopened in January 2011, a new \ncase outstanding is established for both claim amount and defense costs. Ultimately, the claim \nsettles for a greater amount than the case outstanding for both claim amount and defense costs. \n \nSimilar to paid claims, it is important to define the time period when referring to reported claims. \nGenerally, when looking at a specific claim, we use the term \u201creported claims\u201d (or case incurred) \nto mean the sum of cumulative claim payments through a specific date and the case outstanding at \nthe same point in time. Using the example above, the reported claims are: \n \n\uf0be $15,000 at the time of first report (i.e., February 20, 2009) \n  \n\uf0be $15,500 at May 1, 2009 after a payment of $500 to an IA \n \n\uf0be $32,000 at September 1, 2009, when the insurer increases the case outstanding to $30,000 \n($2,000 cumulative paid claims + $30,000 case outstanding) \n \n\uf0be $26,000 upon initial closing on March 1, 2010 ($26,000 cumulative paid claims + $0 case \noutstanding) \n \n\uf0be $46,000 upon reopening on January 25, 2011 ($26,000 cumulative paid claims + $10,000", "type": "Document"}}
