We also observe increasing values of \naverage case outstanding at 48 and 60 months. \n \nWe understand from our meetings with XYZ Insurer management that increased case outstanding \nstrength is a priority. We also know that a review of the average case outstanding shows \nincreasing average values for outstanding claims. However, before accepting that there has been a \nchange in the adequacy of case outstanding, we must ask what effect, if any, is the change in \nclaims settlement having on the average case outstanding. If smaller claims are settling more \nquickly, we are then left with only the more complex and more expensive claims. This, in and of \nitself, would lead to an increase down the columns in the average case outstanding. It is very \nimportant for the actuary to determine how much of the increase in the average case outstanding \nis truly due to a systemic change in the overall level of case outstanding adequacy and how much \nis due to a different mix of claims.  \n \n \nSummary Comments for XYZ Insurer \n \nClearly XYZ Insurer has experienced change over the recent several years. Management \ncommunicated these changes in our last meeting and every claim development diagnostic that we \nreview shows that the changes noted by management are evident. It is now up to the actuary to \ndetermine how to incorporate all this information in the development of an unpaid claim estimate \nto be carried on XYZ Insurer\u2019s financial statements. The changing environment will have an \neffect on the actuary\u2019s choice of estimation techniques, types of data, and actuarial factors within \nthe techniques. We continue to use this example in Part 3 as we introduce basic techniques for \nestimating unpaid claims. \n \n \nConclusions", "type": "Document"}}
