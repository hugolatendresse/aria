The first example is for a portfolio of U.S. medical malpractice insurance \nfor an experience period of 1969 to 1976 (Berq-Sher Med Mal Insurer); and the second example \nis a portfolio of automobile bodily injury liability also for an experience period of 1969 to 1976 \n(Berq-Sher Auto BI Insurer). Notwithstanding the dated nature of these examples, the concepts \nare equally applicable to insurers operating today. Later in this chapter, we use the Berquist-\nSherman adjustments to project ultimate claims for XYZ Insurer. \n \n \nDetecting Changes in the Adequacy Level of Case Outstanding and Reducing the Effect \nof Such Changes on Reported Claims Projections \n \nWe present the analysis for Berq-Sher Med Mal Insurer in Exhibit I, Sheets 1 through 10. In  \nExhibit I, Sheet 1, we present the unadjusted reported claim development triangle. Berquist and \nSherman use the simple average for all years to project ultimate claims. In Exhibit I, Sheet 2, we \nshow the unadjusted paid claim triangle; for paid claims, Berquist and Sherman use the volume-\nweighted average for all years to project ultimate claims. In Exhibit I, Sheet 3, we project the \nunadjusted reported and unadjusted paid claims to an ultimate basis. There are significant \ndifferences in these projections by accident year and in total. It is worth noting that while Berquist \nand Sherman show the paid claim development method in this example for demonstration purposes, \nit is not a reliable projection method due to the highly leveraged nature of the cumulative \ndevelopment factors for almost every accident year in the experience period. (The format of  \nExhibit I, Sheet 3 is similar to that presented in the preceding chapters.) \n \n \n284", "type": "Document"}}
