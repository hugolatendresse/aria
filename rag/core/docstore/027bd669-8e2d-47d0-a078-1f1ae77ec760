Actuaries use a wide variety of averages for age-to-age factors. Some of the \nmost common averages include: \n \n\uf0be Simple (or arithmetic) average \n\uf0be Medial average (average excluding high and low values) \n\uf0be Volume-weighted average \n\uf0be Geometric average (the nth  root of the product of n historical age-to-age factors) \n \nIn Part 3 of Exhibit I, Sheets 1 and 2, we present the following averages for U.S. Industry Auto: \n \n\uf0be Simple averages for the latest five years and the latest three years \n \n\uf0be Medial average for the latest five years excluding one high and one low value (medial latest \n5x1)38 \n \n\uf0be Volume-weighted averages for the latest five years and the latest three years \n \n\uf0be Geometric average for the latest four years \n \nFor reported claims, the 12-24 month simple average of the latest five factors is based on the \naverage of the 12-24 month factors for accident years 2002 through 2006 and is equal to 1.168 \n((1.184 + 1.162 + 1.159 + 1.160 + 1.173) / 5).
