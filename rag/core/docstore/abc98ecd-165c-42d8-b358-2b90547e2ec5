If we \nreview the previous tables, we will note that paid ALAE lagged paid claims only. If these implied \npatterns are, in fact, correct, then there should be a tail factor for the ratio of paid ALAE-to-paid \nclaims only.  \n \nAnother advantage of using a ratio approach is the ability to easily interject actuarial judgment in \nthe projection analysis, particularly for the selection of the ultimate ALAE ratio for the most \nrecent year(s) in the experience period. In Exhibit I, Sheet 8, we use the development technique to \nproject an initial estimate of the ALAE ratio to claim amount of 0.0102 for accident years 2007 \nand 2008. However, based on comparison to the immediate preceding years, 0.0102 seems high. \nThe higher ratio may be due to a change in procedures for recording ALAE or unusually large \nexpenses. The average of the ultimate ALAE ratios for all the years up to 2006 in the experience \nperiod is .0077, and the average for the latest three years excluding 2007 and 2008 is 0.0071. We \nselect an ultimate ALAE ratio for 2007 and 2008 of 0.0077, based on the average for all years. \nWe determine ultimate ALAE based on the multiplication of the selected ultimate claims (from \nExhibit I, Sheet 6) and the ultimate ALAE ratio (from Column (6)). \n \nIn Exhibit I, Sheets 9 and 10, we present an alternative to the standard multiplicative development \nmethod. In our third approach, we use additive rather than multiplicative development factors to \nultimate. The mechanics of this approach are quite similar to the standard method. We first \ndisplay the ratio of paid ALAE-to-paid claims only. (See Part 1 in the top section of Exhibit I, \nSheet 9.) In the middle section of this exhibit (Part 2), we develop age-to-age factors based on the \ndifference between the ratios at successive ages. For example, the 12-to-24 month factor for \naccident year 1998 is equal to the paid ratio of 0.0081 at 24 months minus the paid ratio of 0.0066", "type": "Document"}}
