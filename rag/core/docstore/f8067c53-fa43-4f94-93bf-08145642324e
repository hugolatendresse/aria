Similar to other accident years in our example, there is one claim \nfor accident year 2007 that is not reported by year-end. Thus, the paid claims for accident year 2007 \nat 12 months only include Claim IDs 8, 9, and 10. We note that there is no payment for Claim ID \n10 as of December 31, 2007. Thus, the paid claims value entered in the triangle is the sum of claim \npayments for Claim IDs 8 and 9 ($200 + $460).  \n \nWe leave it to the reader to calculate the final diagonal of the cumulative paid claim triangle.  \n \n \n                                                 \n24 In some applications, it may be far easier to just include Claim 7 as a zero value than to write \nprogramming logic to exclude it from the application.   \n \n57", "type": "Document"}}
