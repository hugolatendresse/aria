Special commercial lines rating mechanisms can be divided into two categories:  \nthose that modify the manual rate and those that derive premium specifically for the large commercial \nrisk.  Manual rate modification plans include experience rating and schedule rating.  Experience rating is \nused when the past loss experience is determined to be reliably predictive of future expected losses.  The \nexperience modification factor is based upon a comparison of the actual experience to the expected \nexperience with credibility taken into consideration.  The actual experience may be evaluated in several \nways, and it is critically important that the actual experience and expected experience are evaluated on a \nconsistent basis before comparison.  Schedule rating alters the manual rate according to characteristics \nthat are expected to have a material effect on the insured\u2019s loss experience relative to that assumed in the \nmanual rate or (if experience rating applies) relative to the manual rate modified by experience rating.     \nRating mechanisms for large commercial risks include loss-rated composite plans, large deductible \npolicies, and retrospective rating.  Loss-rated composite rating plans facilitate rating of large, complex \ncommercial risks through the use of a single, auditable, composite exposure, and derive a rate based \nentirely on the insured\u2019s prior experience.  Large deductible policies are priced similarly to small \ndeductible policies but several special considerations need to be addressed (e.g., how ALAE are treated \n15.17 Prov isions of Plan\n(1) Minimum retrospective premium ratio (negotiated) 60.0%\n(2) Maximum retrospective premium ratio (negotiated) 140.0%\n(3) Loss Conversion Factor (negotiated) 1.10", "type": "Document"}}
