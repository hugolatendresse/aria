The specific circumstances of the stop-loss program could influence the actuary\u2019s decision. \nTypically, the actuary would want data prior to the application of stop-loss or aggregate coverage since \nthe actuary will often adjust for such coverage as a final step in the development of the unpaid claim \nestimate.  \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheet 3, we present a simple example with one approach for adjusting for the effect of \nexcess of loss and stop-loss reinsurance. In this example, we assume that Self-Insurance Pool is an \nassociation of self-insured municipalities that has maintained a $500,000 per occurrence excess of loss \ncoverage since the inception of the pool. The stop-loss coverage, however, has varied over time \ndepending on the availability and price of such coverage. For the first three years of Self-Insurance \nPool, there was a $4 million combined stop-loss (i.e., the stop-loss limit of $4 million applied to the \nsum of ultimate claims for policy years 2002-03 through 2004-05). The stop-loss limit was $1.5 million \nfor policy years 2005-06 and 2006-07. There was no stop-loss coverage purchased for 2007-08. For \nSelf-Insurance Pool, the actuary first estimates ultimate claims using reported and paid claims limited to \nthe per occurrence retention (i.e., $500,000 per occurrence). In Exhibit II, Sheet 3, we summarize the \nselected ultimate claims at $500,000 per occurrence in Column (2) and the stop-loss limits in Column \n(3). In Column (4), we apply the stop-loss limits to derive the estimates of ultimate claims for Self-\nInsurance Pool that take into account both the excess of loss and stop-loss coverages. In the final \ncolumns of this exhibit, we calculate the unpaid claim estimate net of both excess of loss and stop-loss \ncoverage. \n \n                                                 \n81 There are times when the net IBNR will be greater than the gross IBNR.
