The traditional actuarial techniques described thus far determine rates without regard to \nwhether or not the product will be purchased.  Prior to finalizing a rate change, the insurance company \nshould consider both the cost-based rate indication and the marketing conditions. \nWhen contemplating marketing considerations, companies often categorize insureds into new and renewal \nbusiness.

On the other hand, if the product is costly, insureds are more likely to compare prices to \ndetermine any potential savings. \n\uf0b7 Rate changes:  Significant increases (or decreases) in premium for an existing policy can cause \nexisting insureds to believe there may be better options available. \n\uf0b7 Characteristics of the insured:  A large established law firm may be less sensitive to the price of", "type": "Document"}}
