According to the Law of Large Numbers, as the volume of similar, independent \nexposure units increases, the observed experience will approach the \u201ctrue\u201d experience, and for a \nsufficiently large number, the observed experience will equal the \u201ctrue\u201d experience.  The experience of \nany one insured can vary significantly from year to year.  By insuring a large number of independent \nrisks, the experience of the entire group becomes more stable and can be more accurately predicted.  \nUnfortunately, the volume of data used for overall ratemaking or classification ratemaking may not \nalways be fully sufficient to produce accurate and stable rates, and the actuary can consider \nsupplementing the data with additional information.  The science of credibility in ratemaking addresses \nhow to blend the actuarial estimate based on observed experience with one or more sets of related \nexperience in order to improve the estimate of expected values. \nThis chapter covers: \n\uf0b7 Methods for measuring credibility in an actuarial estimate44 \n\uf0b7 Desirable qualities for the complement of credibility \n\uf0b7 Methods (and examples) for determining the complement of credibility in both first dollar and \nexcess ratemaking \n\uf0b7 A brief commentary on credibility when using statistical multivariate ratemaking techniques   \nNECESSARY\tCRITERIA\tFOR\tMEASURES\tOF\tCREDIBILITY \nThe first step in utilizing credibility is to determine the reliability of the actuarial estimate based on \nobserved experience.  Assuming homogenous risks, the amount of credibility given to the observed \nexperience, commonly denoted by Z, should meet the following three basic criteria: \n1. Z must be greater than or equal to zero (i.e., no negative credibility) and less than or equal to 1.00 \n(i.e., capped at fully credible).", "type": "Document"}}
