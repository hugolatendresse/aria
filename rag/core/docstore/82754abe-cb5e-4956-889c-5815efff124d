The \nuse of multi-state data generally implies the complement is reasonably accurate as long as there is \nsufficient countrywide data to minimize the process variance.  Also, since the subject experience and \nrelated experience consider data from different states, the complement is considered mostly independent.  \nThe data for the complement is usually available but the computations can be time-consuming and \ncomplicated.  While the complement bears a logical relationship to the subject experience, the \ncomplement may be harder to explain because of the computational complexity. \nTrended\tPresent\tRates\t\nIn cases where there is no larger group to use for the complement, actuaries may rely on the current rates \nas the best available proxy for the indicated rate.  Typically, two adjustments are made before using the \ncurrent rates to make this a suitable alternative.  \nFirst, insurers do not always implement the rate that is indicated (reasons for this are discussed in Chapter \n13).  Thus, the current rates should be adjusted to what was previously indicated rather than what was \nimplemented.", "type": "Document"}}
