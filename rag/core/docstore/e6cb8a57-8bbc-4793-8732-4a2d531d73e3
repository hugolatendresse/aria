One possible \nbenchmark includes experience from similar lines with similar claims handling practices within \nthe insurer. Another source of benchmarks is claim development patterns from the insurance \nindustry when observable and considered to be comparable. Any benchmark must be utilized with \ncaution, as there may be significant differences between the line of business being analyzed and \nthe benchmark with regard to claims practices, policy coverages, underwriting, geographic mix, \nclaim coding, policyholder deductibles and/or limits, legal precedents, etc. Such differences could \nmake the development patterns noncomparable and increase the variability in the estimates of \nunpaid claims. (For further discussion on the use of industry benchmark experience, see Chapter \n3.40) \n \nWhen selecting claim development factors, actuaries review the claim development experience \nfor the following characteristics: \n \n\u2015 Smooth progression of individual age-to-age factors and average factors across development \nperiods. Ideally, the pattern should demonstrate steadily decreasing incremental development \nfrom valuation to valuation (i.e., as we move further away from the accident period), especially in \nthe later valuations. For U.S. Industry Auto, we observe decreasing values of age-to-age factors in \nvirtually every interval (moving across the columns) for both reported claims and paid claims. \n \n\u2015 Stability of age-to-age factors for the same development period. Ideally, there should be a \nrelatively small range of factors (small variance) within each development interval (i.e., down \nthe columns). We look for stability of age-to-age factors and within the various averages for", "type": "Document"}}
