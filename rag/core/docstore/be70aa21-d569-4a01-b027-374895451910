On the other hand, \nschedule rating may apply. \nExample\tCalculation\t\nBob\u2019s Rentals is an equipment dealer that sells new and used equipment, operates a repair and service \nshop, and offers leases and rentals on equipment it owns.  The calculation of the commercial general \nliability (CGL) policy premium for this type of business is generally complex because each of the three \noperations is rated separately, and the exposure base for each operation is different.  The exposure for \nsales on new and used equipment is receipts (in $000s) attributable only to sales on new and used \nequipment.  The exposure for the repair and service shop is payroll (in $00s) relating to workers in the \nrepair and service shop, and the exposure for leases and rentals is receipts (in $000s) attributable only to \nleases and rentals.     \nBob\u2019s Rentals is sufficiently large enough to meet the eligibility requirements for loss rating under ISO\u2019s \nComposite Rating Plan and desires coverage up to $250,000 per occurrence with $500,000 general \naggregate for its exposure to commercial general liability.   \nThe following are the last five years of reported losses and ALAE across all three operations, separated \ninto bodily injury and property damage.
