The home is located \nin Territory 1 and the insured has a $250 deductible.  The policy remains unchanged for the full \nterm of the policy.  \n\uf0b7 Policy B is written on April 1, 2010, with an annual premium of $600.  The home is located in \nTerritory 2 and the insured has a deductible of $250.  The policy is canceled on December 31, \n2010.   \n\uf0b7 Policy C is written on July 1, 2010, with an annual premium of $1,000.  The home is located in \nTerritory 3 and has a deductible of $500.  On January 1, 2011, the insured decreases the \ndeductible to $250.  The full annual term premium after the deductible change is $1,200.   \n \nPolicy A expired at its original expiration date and had no changes, thus the entire policy can be \nrepresented with one record.   \nPolicy B was canceled before the policy expired.  This is represented by two records.  The first record for \nPolicy B contains the information known at the inception of the policy (e.g., one exposure and $600 in \nwritten premium).  The second record represents an adjustment for the cancelation such that when \naggregated, the two records show a result net of cancellation.  As the policy was canceled 75% of the way \nthrough the policy period, the second record should show -0.25 exposure and -$150 (=25% x -$600) of \nwritten premium.", "type": "Document"}}
