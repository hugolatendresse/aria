When \nan insurer pays an insured for a claim considered to be a total loss, the insurer acquires the rights to \nthe damaged property. Salvage represents any amount that the insurer is able to collect from the \nsale of such damaged property. Subrogation refers to an insurer\u2019s right to recover the amount of \nclaim payment to a covered insured from a third-party responsible for the injury or damage.  \n \nIn Chapter 3 \u2013 Information Gathering, we discuss the importance of the actuary understanding the \ninsurer\u2019s practices with respect to S&S. The actuary needs to know whether paid claims are \nrecorded net or gross of these recoveries.  \n \n \nSalvage, Subrogation, and Collateral Sources \n \nSome insurers maintain detailed information regarding case outstanding estimates and payments \nfor the different types of recoveries (e.g., salvage, subrogation, deductibles, and collateral \nsources). Other insurers may combine claims data for all types of recoveries; many insurers \nrecord only payments and do not estimate case outstanding for recoveries. Finally, some insurers \ntreat recoveries as a negative claim payment and do not maintain separate data for recoveries. In \norder for the actuary to determine how to quantify the potential effect of S&S, he or she must \nunderstand how the insurer processes such recoveries and what data is available for analysis. \n \nWhen S&S data is available, actuaries frequently use the development technique to quantify the \neffect of S&S recoveries on estimates of total unpaid claims. The salvage portion of such \nrecoveries is most commonly associated with property coverages and tends to be fast reporting \nand fast settling.
