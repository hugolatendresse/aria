We continue these examples using the Cape Cod method.  \n \n \nScenario 1 \u2013 U.S. PP Auto Steady-State \n \nWe see in Chapters 7 through 9 that the development technique, expected claims technique, and \nBornhuetter-Ferguson techniques all generate an accurate IBNR value in a steady-state \nenvironment. It is not surprising to find that the Cape Cod method also generates the actual IBNR \nin a steady-state environment. The top section of Exhibit III, Sheets 1 and 3, contains detailed \ncalculations for the Cape Cod method. \n \n \n                                                 \n59 We present the following examples to demonstrate the effect of not changing assumption on the resulting \nprojections of ultimate claims and the estimate of unpaid claims. We recognize that the examples are not \nnecessarily representative of real-life applications of the Cape Cod method since we assume that there are \nno adjustments in expected claims in anticipation of the events that caused higher claim ratios or changes in \nbusiness mix. Most insurers have a feel for whether a market is getting softer or harder, so they would have \na sense as to the direction to adjust the expected claims, if not the absolute amount of adjustment.  \n177", "type": "Document"}}
