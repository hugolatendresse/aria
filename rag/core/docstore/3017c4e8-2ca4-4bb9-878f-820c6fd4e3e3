We assume that we can estimate the expected claim ratio appropriately for the combined \nportfolio. This is much easier when the proportion of each of the two categories remains \nconsistent over time. We demonstrate in Exhibit V, that the expected claims technique will \ngenerate the correct IBNR requirement in times of no change. \n \n \nU.S. Auto Changing Product Mix  \n \nIn the final example, we assume that the volume of commercial automobile insurance is \nincreasing at a greater rate than that of private passenger automobile insurance. Since commercial \nautomobile insurance has higher ultimate claim ratios, the actuary will need to modify the \nexpected claim ratio assumption, which is critical to the expected claims technique. The bottom \nsection of Exhibit V demonstrates that without a change in the expected claim ratio, the expected \nclaims technique will produce an inadequate estimate of IBNR. \n139", "type": "Document"}}
