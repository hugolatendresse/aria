For some lines of business, a single payment may be the norm, and thus, such \npayment may in fact represent settlement (i.e., closure) of the claim, and therefore the end of the \nclaims handling activity. An example is glass coverage to replace a shattered windshield under \nautomobile physical damage insurance. (Note, not all automobile physical damage insurance can \nnecessarily be categorized as single payment where payment equates to closure of the claim.) An \nexample of insurance where a claim payment and closing of the claim often differ is U.S. workers \ncompensation; for this coverage, regular payments can replace lost wages for an extended period \nof time.  \n \nSome actuaries address this challenge by adjusting the percentages applied to the case \noutstanding and the IBNR to reflect their expectations for the particular company. For example, \nan actuary of an insurer with a portfolio of long-tail professional liability coverage, which is \ncharacterized by very long-tailed liabilities and substantial claims-handling work during the life \nof the claim, estimates unpaid ULAE assuming ratios of 25% applied to case outstanding and \n75% to IBNR, which includes development on case outstanding. Thus, they assume a greater \nproportion of the expenses are related to closing the claims rather than opening claims. \n \nThe definition of IBNR poses another challenge for actuaries using the classical technique. \nActuaries typically use the broad definition of IBNR, and thus IBNR reserves represent the \nliability for both claims that are not yet reported as well as future case development on known \nclaims. As described in Chapter 1, claims that are incurred but not yet reported (IBNYR) are also \n388", "type": "Document"}}
