For instance, an insurer might concentrate its advertising on areas in \nwhich it believes the rate levels to be adequate.   \n\uf0b7 In the case of banned or restricted usage of a particular variable (e.g., insurance credit scores), a \ncompany can use a different allowable rating variable (e.g., payment history with the company) \nthat it believes can explain some or all of the effect associated with the restricted variable.   \nOPERATIONAL\tCONSTRAINTS\t\t\nOperational constraints can make it difficult or undesirable for a company to implement the actuarially \nindicated rate change.  Operational constraints can include items like systems limitations and resource \nconstraints.   \nIn order for premium quotes to be generated automatically when a customer\u2019s information is collected, \nrating algorithms, rates, and rate differentials need to be programmed.  Base rates and rate differentials \n(e.g., relativities or addends) can usually be changed easily.  For many companies, however, modifying \nthe structure of the rating algorithm can require significant systems changes.  The complexity of the \nchange depends largely on two factors: \n\uf0b7 The extent of the structural changes (e.g., the number of rating variables, the number of levels \nwithin each rating variable, how the rating variables are applied in the rating algorithm)", "type": "Document"}}
