An insured loss that occurred on December 30, 2008, \nfor a policy written on December 15, 2008, would be included in the estimate of unpaid claims \nfor the accounting date December 31, 2008, regardless of when the claim is reported to the \ninsurer. However, an insured loss that occurred on January 5, 2009, for the same policy that was \nwritten on December 15, 2008, would not be included in the unpaid claim estimate for the \naccounting date December 31, 2008, because this accident occurred after the accounting date. \n \nThe valuation date is the date through which transactions are included in the database used in the \nevaluation of the liability, regardless of when the actuary performs the analysis. A valuation date \nmay be prior to, coincident with, or subsequent to the accounting date. Actuaries typically use \nclaims data at month-end, quarter-end, half-year-end, or year-end valuation dates.  \n \nAgain, examples may assist in understanding the concept of valuation date. To determine total \nunpaid claims at December 31, 2008, actuaries may use data valued as of December 31, 2008. In \nthis example, the valuation date and the accounting date are the same. For some insurers, \nhowever, internal financial reporting requirements at year-end are such that the actuary does not \nhave time to wait for the December 31, 2008 data to be available. In such circumstances, \nactuaries often use data at an earlier valuation date to estimate what the requirement for unpaid \nclaims at the accounting date of December 31, 2008 will be. For example, some insurers used \ndata as of September 30, 2008 to estimate unpaid claims as of December 31, 2008. In this \nexample, the valuation date is September 30, 2008, and the accounting date is December 31, \n2008.", "type": "Document"}}
