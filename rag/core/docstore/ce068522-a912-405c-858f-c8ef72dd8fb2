Significantly more analysis can be \ncompleted for those expenses that are assigned to an individual claim (allocated \nexpenses) because more data exists. For instance, the accident date of the claim \nthat generated the expense is known for an allocated expense, but unknown for \nan unallocated expense.88  \n \nAll of the development techniques described in Part 3 can be used with ALAE. The greatest \nchallenge for the actuary is often obtaining data for ALAE separate from claim only data. In order \nfor the actuary to determine how to estimate unpaid ALAE, he or she must understand how the \ninsurer processes such expenses and what data is available for analysis. \n \nMany insurers record only ALAE payments and do not separately estimate case outstanding for \nALAE. Other insurers may combine data for all types of ALAE. Some insurers maintain detailed \ninformation regarding case outstanding estimates and payments for the different types of ALAE \n(e.g., defense costs, expert witness fees, claims adjusting, and investigation). Mr. Wiser \ncomments on the value of splitting the analysis of ALAE by subcategory: \n \nThe most important subcategory is attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs. It will often be \nconducive to obtaining better estimates of loss adjustment expense to develop \nlegal expense separate from all other allocated expense items. \n \nDue to data limitations, actuaries often combine ALAE with claims data for the purpose of \ndetermining estimates of unpaid ALAE. However, it is important that the actuary recognizes that", "type": "Document"}}
