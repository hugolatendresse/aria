Sequential \nanalysis involves making only one pass through the sequence of chosen rating variables (rather than \niterating until convergence is achieved).  The main criticism of the non-iterative sequential approach is \nthat it does not have a closed form solution; the results vary depending on the order of the rating variables \nin the sequence.

However, many of the minimum bias procedures are actually a subset \nof the statistical method, generalized linear models (GLMs).  In fact, iterating the minimum bias \nprocedure a sufficient number of times may result in convergence with GLM results, though many would \nargue the minimum bias procedures involve less computational efficiency.  Stephen Mildenhall\u2019s paper, \n\u201cA Systematic Relationship between Minimum Bias and Generalized Linear Models\u201d (Mildenhall 1999) \ndemonstrates that many of the minimum bias procedures correspond directly to generalized linear models. \nSeveral things happened around the late 20th century and start of the 21st century that led to the adoption \nof statistical techniques, particularly generalized linear models, for classification ratemaking.
