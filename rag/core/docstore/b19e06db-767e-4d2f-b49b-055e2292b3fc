In addition, the estimates will be influenced by parameters \nnot explicitly considered in the article, such as the implicit assumption that equal amounts of \nULAE resources are required to open, close, and handle one average claim for a year. \n \n \nRahardjo  \n \nIn her paper \u201cA Methodology for Pricing and Reserving for Claim Expenses in Workers \nCompensation,\u201d109 Kay Kellogg Rahardjo discusses the fact that different levels of work effort \nare required for handling claims in the first 30 days than for claims that have been open for five \nyears. One focus of Rahardjo\u2019s paper is the length of time for which workers compensation \nclaims remain open, which she defines to be the \u201cduration.\u201d She states: \u201cAs duration increases, so \ndoes the expense of handling the claim for the remainder of the claim\u2019s life.\u201d \n \nRahardjo also presents a methodology for pricing claims-handling services which is applicable to \nthird-party claims administrators (TPAs). Self-insurance and large deductible plans are now \ncommonplace means of financing risk. However, few self-insureds handle their own risks; instead \nthey outsource those responsibilities to TPAs. Thus, Rahardjo\u2019s technique could be useful to such \norganizations in need of a method for estimating the cost of future TPAs claims handling (i.e., \nunpaid ULAE). \n \n \nSpalla \n \nJoanne Spalla asserts that manual time-and-motion studies are no longer necessary to determine \nthe costs of various claim-related activities and transactions. Since so many claims-related \nactivities are computer-supported, she suggests using modern claim department information \nsystems to track the time spent on individual claims by level of employee.  \n \nBy combining individual claim management activities into somewhat more macroscopic", "type": "Document"}}
