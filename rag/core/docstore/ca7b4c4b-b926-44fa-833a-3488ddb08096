The self-insured organization provided us with the payroll for both accident \nyears. We multiply the payroll by the selected frequency rates to determine the projected ultimate \nnumber of claims (Line (3)). We then multiply the ultimate number of claims by the selected \nseverities to derive the projected ultimate claims (Line (5)).  \n \n \nDevelop Unpaid Claim Estimate \n \nEstimated IBNR is equal to projected ultimate claims less reported claims; and the total unpaid \nclaim estimate is equal to estimated IBNR plus case outstanding. \n \n \nAnalysis for XYZ Insurer \n \nWe continue the example presented in Exhibit II for XYZ Insurer. (See Exhibit IV, Sheets 1 \nthrough 3.) We use the second frequency-severity approach to review the experience of older, \nmore mature accident years for the purpose of determining estimates of both frequency and \nseverity for 2007 and 2008. In this second approach, we incorporate adjustments for rate level \nchanges, inflation, and tort reform. \n  \nIn Exhibit IV, Sheet 1, we first summarize the selected ultimate claim counts for accident years \n2002 through 2006. In this example, we rely on the reported claim count projection instead of the \naverage of the reported and closed count projections. (See Exhibit II, Sheet 3.) Based on our \nanalysis of insurance industry trends, we assume an annual -1.5% claims frequency trend for this \nportfolio.  \n \nIdeally, the actuary would have vehicle or policy count available as an exposure base when \nconducting an analysis of unpaid claims for automobile liability insurance. However, there are \nnumerous situations in which reliable exposure and policy count data is not available. For XYZ \nInsurer, earned premium is the only exposure data available.
