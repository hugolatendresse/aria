We reproduce the Berq-Sher Auto BI Insurer example in Exhibit II, \nSheets 1 through 12. In Exhibit II, Sheet 1, we present the unadjusted paid claim development \ntriangle analysis; we include this analysis for comparison purposes with the Berquist-Sherman \nadjusted paid claim triangle. Berquist and Sherman use the volume-weighted average for all years \nto project ultimate claims.  \n \nSimilar to the previous example, we test the data to determine if the rate of claims settlement is \nconsistent for the reviewed line over the experience period (i.e., the underlying assumption of the \npaid claim development technique). In Exhibit II, Sheet 2, we summarize closed and reported \nclaim counts and the ratio of closed-to-reported claim counts. When we look down each column \nof the ratio triangle, we readily see evidence of a steady decrease in the rate of claim settlement \nover the experience period. Thus, the primary assumption of the paid claim development method \ndoes not appear to hold true for Berq-Sher Auto BI Insurer, and the method would likely \nunderstate the true value required for unpaid claims. \n \n \nMechanics of the Berquist-Sherman Paid Claim Development Adjustment \n \nThe first step of the Berquist-Sherman paid claims adjustment is to determine the disposal rates \nby accident year and maturity. Berquist and Sherman use the same definition of disposal rates as \nthat presented in the final frequency-severity approach of Chapter 11. (It is worthwhile to note \nthat the definition of disposal rate differs among different authors in published actuarial papers.) \nTo determine the disposal rates, we first project the number of ultimate claims based on reported", "type": "Document"}}
