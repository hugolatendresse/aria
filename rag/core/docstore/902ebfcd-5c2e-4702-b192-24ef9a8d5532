This is the process of adjusting historical \nlosses for time-related influences such as inflation in order to project losses to the future policy period.  \nThe simple excess loss procedure outlined above is ideally performed on reported losses that have been \ntrended to future levels.  In other words, excess losses are calculated by censoring trended ground-up \nlosses.18  Losses in higher layers of insurance are often subject to greater inflationary pressure than losses \nin lower layers.  Ignoring this effect introduces some bias in the excess loss procedure.  More detail \nregarding this leveraging effect is covered later in this chapter as well. \nIn addition to the simple procedure outlined above, some actuaries may fit statistical distributions to \nempirical data and simulate claim experience in order to calculate the expected excess losses.   \nCatastrophe\tLosses\t\nSimilarly, ratemaking data often excludes losses arising from catastrophic events.  Unlike shock losses \nthat are individual high severity claims, a catastrophe denotes a natural or man-made disaster that is \n                                                      \n18 Alternatively, the excess loss threshold can be indexed to reflect trend, and then applied to ground-up losses that \nhave not been trended. \n6.3  E xcess Loss Proced ure\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nLos s es  Exces s  \nof\n$1,000,000 \n1996 118,369,707$     5 6,232,939 $      1,232,939 $      117,136,768$      1.1%\n1997 117,938,146$     1 1,300,000 $      300,000 $         117,638,146$      0.3%\n1998 119,887,865$     3 3,923,023 $      923,023 $         118,964,842$      0.8%\n1999 118,488,983$     0 - $                 - $                 118,488,983$      0.0%\n2000 122,329,298$     7 12,938,382 $    5,938,382 $      116,390,916$      5.1%", "type": "Document"}}
