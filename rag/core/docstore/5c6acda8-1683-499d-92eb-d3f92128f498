In such situations, the actuary may then use the \nselected net claim development factors as input for the selection of gross claim development \nfactors. The important point to remember is that there should generally be a reasonable \nrelationship between the selected development factors for net and gross claims. It should be \nrecognized, however, that this is not always the case. \n \nSimilarly, the actuary must consider the reasonableness of trend assumptions between the net and gross \nor ceded and gross analyses as well as expected claim ratios, frequency, and severity assumptions. At \nthe final stages of the analysis, when the actuary is selecting ultimate claims, the actuary must review \nthe implied relationship between the net and gross claims and resulting estimates of unpaid claims to \nensure that the ceded claims are reasonable, or alternatively the relationship between gross and ceded \nultimate claims to ensure that net ultimate claims and unpaid claim estimates are appropriate. A critical \npoint is that net IBNR in each accident year is generally not greater than gross IBNR.81 \n \nMany insurers also use aggregate or stop-loss coverage to protect their financial results across multiple \nlines of coverage. This coverage can apply on an accident year, policy year, or calendar year basis. In \naddition to fully understanding how the coverage operates, it is important that the actuary understands \nhow the insurer treats prior recoveries from aggregate coverage in the source data used in the actuarial \nanalysis of unpaid claims. The actuary will need to determine whether or not he or she should take stop-\nloss or aggregate programs into account within the claim development triangles or at a later stage of the", "type": "Document"}}
