The claim ratios are \nthe same as those of the second scenario, and we assume changes in case outstanding strength \nthat are similar to the third scenario. Once again, the paid claim development method produces \nthe actual value for IBNR. The reported claim development method, while responsive to the \nincreasing claim ratios, overstates the estimate of unpaid claims due to the changing case \noutstanding adequacy. The reported claim development technique produces a total unpaid claim \nestimate that is more than 20% greater than actual total unpaid claims and adds 22 points to the \n2008 calendar year claim ratio. \n \n \nChanges in Product Mix  \n \nIn this final example, we focus on the effect of changes in product mix on the development \ntechnique. In Chapter 6, we discuss the challenge for the actuary in finding homogeneous \ngroupings of data while maintaining a sufficient volume of claims to be credible. In our final \nexample of this chapter, we look at a portfolio of business in which we combine private passenger \nand commercial automobile insurance for the purpose of estimating unpaid claims. Typically, \nthese categories of business have different underlying claim development patterns and ultimate \nclaim ratios. We will see that the development technique is an acceptable method for determining \nestimates of unpaid claims for the combined portfolio as long as there are no changes in the mix \nof business (i.e., one line of business is not significantly increasing or decreasing in volume", "type": "Document"}}
