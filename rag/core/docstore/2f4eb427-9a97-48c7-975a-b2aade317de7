In this exhibit, we summarize the estimated annual \nrate of change (i.e., trend rate) and the goodness-of-fit test (i.e., R-squared).64 Based on GL \nInsurer\u2019s experience alone, we do not find a particularly good fit to the data. However, based on \nour knowledge of industry-wide experience for this particular product type, supplemented with \nthis insurer\u2019s limited data, we select a 5% annual severity trend rate.65 There is some evidence, \nbased on our example, that trend rates may differ and may be greater for the older maturities. \nHowever, to simplify our example we use a single trend rate for all maturities. We recommend \nthat you test the sensitivity of alternative trend rate assumptions at different maturities. \n \n                                                 \n64 It is important to recognize that regression with only a few data points may not be very meaningful and \ncertainly is not very robust. The parameter estimate and R-squared can change dramatically by using \ndifferent segments of the data, as in our example with all years versus latest six years or latest four years. \nAn extreme example is when there are only two data points to fit; in such situations there will always be a \nperfect fit and 100% R-squared. In our example, there are only two points at 84 months. We note that the \nactuary must take care in interpreting the results of any regression analysis when there are limited data \npoints. \n \n65 We have already addressed the challenges of using benchmark data several times in this book. We further \npoint out that the potential difficulties in using industry-wide severity trends for general liability. The \ngeneral liability line of business can include a very diverse mixture of coverages including but not limited \nto: excess health, employers\u2019 liability, first-dollar premises and operations, personal umbrella, contractors\u2019 \nliability, and environmental.
