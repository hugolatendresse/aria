By doing this, the companies were able to attract a large \nportion of the profitable adult risks from their competitors.  Furthermore, those youthful operators who \nchose to insure with them were written profitably.    \nIn some cases, the company may not be able to (or may choose not to) implement a new or refined rating \nvariable.  If allowed by law, the company may continue to charge the average rate but utilize the \ncharacteristic to identify, attract, and select the lower-risk insureds that exist in the insured population; \nthis is called \u201cskimming the cream.\u201d  If the company can effectively focus on attracting and keeping the \nlower-risk insureds, the company will be more profitable than the competitors.  Ultimately, the company \nwill be able to lower the average rate to reflect the better overall quality of the insured risks.   \nCRITERIA\tFOR\tEVALUATING\tRATING\tVARIABLES\t\nThe first step in classification ratemaking is to identify the rating variables that will be used to segment \nthe insured population into different groups of similar risks for the purposes of rating.  For example, a \nworkers compensation carrier needs to decide whether or not the number, type, and skill level of \nemployees are risk characteristics that will be used as rating variables for workers compensation \ninsurance.", "type": "Document"}}
