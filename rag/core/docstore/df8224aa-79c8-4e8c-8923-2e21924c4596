The rate of change of that decrease will vary depending on the \nshape of the loss distribution: \n\uf0b7 Right-skewed distribution (i.e., small losses predominate):  the rate will decrease at a decreasing \nrate as the policy face value increases. \n\uf0b7 Uniform distribution (i.e., all losses equally likely):  the rate will decrease at a constant rate as the \npolicy face value increases. \n\uf0b7 Left-skewed distribution (i.e., large losses predominate):  the rate will decrease at an increasing \nrate as the policy face value increases. \nUnder the rate approach (as opposed to the coinsurance penalty), the coinsurance is really thought to be \nany portion of the loss that exceeds the face value should the insured choose a face value less than the full \nvalue of the property.
