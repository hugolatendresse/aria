For example, a company may decide to cap the renewal premium \nincrease for each individual insured to 15%.  If the company\u2019s rate change results in an insured receiving \na 20% premium increase, the insured will receive a 15% rate change at the first renewal following the \nimplementation of the rate change, and the remaining 4.3% ( = 1.20 / 1.15 - 1.0 ) at the second renewal. \nThe following are some key considerations when using a premium transition rule: \n\uf0b7 The company needs to determine the maximum and minimum premium change amounts.  As \ndiscussed in Chapter 13, the company can test various scenarios of minimum and maximum \namounts, to determine the optimal selections.    \n\uf0b7 Typically premium transition rules apply only to premium changes directly resulting from \ncompany initiated rate changes.  If premium change is affected by a change in risk characteristics \n(e.g., the insured buys a newer car), the transition rule algorithm must be adjusted to neutralize \nthe effect of the risk characteristics change.  For example, the premium change may be calculated \nas the ratio of new premium on new risk characteristics to old premium on new risk \ncharacteristics.   \n\uf0b7 The length of time necessary to fully transition the renewal portfolio to the manual rates depends \non the extent of the proposed rate change and the premium transition rule implemented.  The \ncompany should try to avoid long transition periods in order to minimize the chances of multiple \noverlapping transition periods created by multiple rate changes.   \n\uf0b7 The effect on the average premium level should also be considered and the base rate altered \naccordingly.  The actuary must decide whether the base rate should be set so that the equilibrium \nis achieved over the whole time the proposed rates are in effect, or by the expected end of the", "type": "Document"}}
