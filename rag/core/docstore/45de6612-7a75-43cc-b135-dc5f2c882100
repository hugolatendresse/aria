Two reasons that a company may implement something other \nthan the indicated rates are regulatory constraints and operational constraints.  In addition, marketing \nconsiderations such as competitive position, customer demand, and underwriting cycle may lead the \ncompany to deviate from indicated rates.  Traditional pricing strategy incorporates these market \nconsiderations judgmentally, but advanced techniques such as lifetime customer value and optimized \npricing can accomplish this more systematically.", "type": "Document"}}
