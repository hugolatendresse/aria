Table 15.4 lists the actual losses from the last three complete policy years.  The losses are \nseparated into primary and excess components.  The primary losses are capped at $5,000 and the excess \nlosses are calculated as the portion of each individual loss above $5,000.   \n \nTable 15.5 shows the calculation of expected losses based upon payroll and the expected loss rate,52 \nwhich reflects the expected loss as of the policy\u2019s evaluation date.
