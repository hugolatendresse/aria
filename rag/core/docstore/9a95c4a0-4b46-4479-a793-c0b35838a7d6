An exact calculation of S\u0394 can be made using the \nextension of exposures method described earlier in this section.  When data at that level of detail is not \navailable, the change in average rate differential needs to be approximated. \nWhen the rating algorithm is entirely multiplicative, the formula for the approximated average rate \ndifferential across all variables is shown below (the subscript w refers to each rating variable).
