In Exhibit V, we present an example of this approach for a portfolio of \ngeneral liability insurance (GL Insurer) and in Exhibit VI for XYZ Insurer. \n \nIn the following sections, we describe each of the three frequency-severity approaches in detail \nincluding the key assumptions and the mechanics of each technique.  \n \n \nFrequency-Severity Approach #1 \u2013 Development Technique with Claim \nCounts and Severities \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nTwo of the major requirements of frequency-severity techniques are that the individual claim \ncounts being grouped are defined in a consistent manner over the experience period and that the \nclaim counts are reasonably homogenous. For example, it is not appropriate to group together \nclaimant counts and occurrence counts, which record all claimants under the occurrence as a \nsingle claim, unless the mix of the two ways of counting a claim is consistent. It is also important \nthat the type of claim be reasonably homogenous. For example, it is not reasonable to combine \nthe average values for slip-and-fall claims with those resulting from class action proceedings in \nwhich thousands of injured parties are grouped together; such average values would have little \nmeaning. Likewise, it is not appropriate to analyze first-dollar, low-limit claims with high-layer, \nmulti-million dollar, excess claims. \n \n195", "type": "Document"}}
