Why are the reported claims so low after 12 and 24 \nmonths of development? When comparing the changes in claims by year to the changes in \npremiums by year, we need to first consider the rate level history for the insurer. According to \nTable 1, we know that the insurer had a 5% higher rate level in 2003 than 2002. Thus, it \nappears that the insurer experienced an exposure growth of approximately 8% in 2003 \n([(($69,175 / 1.05) / $61,183) \u2013 1.00]). Knowing that the insurer actually increased its exposure \nbase, it is surprising to see a 25% drop in reported claims for 2003 after 12 months of \ndevelopment.  For the 36-, 48-, and 60-month valuations, reported claims for accident year \n2003 appear to return to levels similar to those experienced in 2002. What led to the lower level \nof reported claims for the first 24 months? Was there a change in systems? Were paid claims or", "type": "Document"}}
