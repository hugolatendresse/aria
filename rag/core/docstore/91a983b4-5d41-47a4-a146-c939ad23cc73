We can classify data as originating from either internal or external sources. \n \n \nSources of Data  \n \nLarge insurers are usually able to generate the detailed claims and exposure data required by \nactuaries for the estimation of unpaid claims from their own management information systems. \nThus, actuaries working for large insurers often rely solely on data produced internally. \n \nSmaller insurers, however, may be more limited in the internal data that they can generate. The \ndata may be limited in its volume and thus its credibility to the actuary, or the data may be \nunavailable due to systems limitations of the organization. Such situations may force actuaries to \nturn to external sources of data. Large insurers who recently entered a new line of insurance or a \nnew geographical region (e.g., a new territory, state, or province) may also need to turn to \nexternal sources of information when developing estimates of unpaid claims.  \n \nThe sources of readily available external data vary by jurisdiction and by product line. The \nfollowing are examples of external sources of information available in certain jurisdictions: \n \nUnited States \n\uf0be Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) \n\uf0be National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) \n\uf0be Reinsurance Association of America (RAA) \n\uf0be The Surety & Fidelity Association of America (SFAA) \n\uf0be A.M.

(MSA) \n \nMany insurers (of all sizes) use a combination of internally-generated data and external industry", "type": "Document"}}
