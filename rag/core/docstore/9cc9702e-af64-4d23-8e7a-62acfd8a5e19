This does not imply, however, that the \nratemaking actuary\u2019s role is at all diminished.  In fact, the use of such methods means the actuary should \nfocus attention on areas such as: \n\uf0b7 ensuring data is adequate for the level of detail of the classification ratemaking analysis (avoiding \nwhat is known as the GIGO principle:  Garbage In, Garbage Out) \n\uf0b7 identifying when anomalous results dictate additional exploratory analysis \n\uf0b7 reviewing model results in consideration of both statistical theory and business application \n\uf0b7 developing appropriate methods to communicate model results in light of a company\u2019s \nratemaking objectives (e.g., policyholder dislocation, competitive position) \n \nThis list is hardly exhaustive.  The nature of statistical modeling for classification ratemaking is such that \nmore work can always be done.  The retrieval of data alone requires careful consideration of necessary \nvolume of data; definition of homogeneous claim types; method of organization (e.g., policy year versus \ncalendar-accident year); the treatment of midterm policy changes, large losses, underwriting changes \nduring the experience period, and the effect of inflation and loss development.  Actuaries always have to \nbalance stability and responsiveness as it relates to choice of experience period as well as to geographies \nto be included in the analysis (e.g., countrywide versus individual state analysis).  Most importantly, \ncommercial considerations such as IT constraints, marketing objectives, and regulatory requirements have \nto be carefully incorporated into the statistical analysis before any results are implemented in practice.   \nThe ratemaking actuary is best served to have a solid background in the company\u2019s data warehouses, to", "type": "Document"}}
