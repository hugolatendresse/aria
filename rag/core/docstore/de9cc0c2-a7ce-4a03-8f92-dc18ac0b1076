Care must be taken when using this type of analysis, however, as a change in one variable\u2019s \nrate relativities can have an unintended impact on the average premium of a certain level of another \nvariable.  For example, if square footage is introduced as a rating variable in homeowners insurance, it \nmay significantly change the average premium of certain territories or amount of insurance levels (as \nthose characteristics tend to be highly correlated with square footage). \nClose\tRatios,\tRetention\tRatios,\tGrowth\t\nClose ratio (also known as hit ratio, quote-to-close ratio, or conversion rate) is a measure of the rate at \nwhich prospective insureds accept a new business quote and is defined as follows: \n .Quotes ofNumber   Total\nQuotes  Accepted ofNumber Ratio Close \uf03d              \nThus if the company issues 25,000 quotes in a particular month and generates 6,000 new policies from \nthose quotes, then the close ratio is 24% (= 6,000 / 25,000).  Care should be taken to understand the data \nused to calculate the ratio, especially when comparing to another carrier\u2019s ratio.  For example, \nCompany A may include in the denominator all quotes issued, and Company B may only include one \nquote per applicant.  If this is the case, Company A will have a lower close ratio, all else being equal, if \napplicants routinely request more than one quote before making a decision (e.g., if an applicant gets \nseveral quotes with different limits).   \n  \nAverage Premium Comparison\n300\n500\n700\n900\n110 0\n13 0 0\n15 0 0\nAge of Driver\nAverage Premium\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n10 0\nVehicle Count\nVehicle Count\nCompany A\nCompany B\n13.9  Average Premium Comparisons", "type": "Document"}}
