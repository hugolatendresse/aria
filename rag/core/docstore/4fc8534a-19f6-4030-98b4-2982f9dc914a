Loss \nadjustment expenses can be separated into allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) and unallocated \nloss adjustment expenses (ULAE):1  \n  ULAE. ALAE   LAE \uf02b\uf03d  \nALAE are claim-related expenses that are directly attributable to a specific claim; for example, fees \nassociated with outside legal counsel hired to defend a claim can be directly assigned to a specific claim.  \nULAE are claim-related expenses that cannot be directly assigned to a specific claim.  For example, \nsalaries of claims department personnel are not readily assignable to a specific claim and are categorized \nas ULAE.   \nChapter 6 reviews loss and LAE data in detail, and outlines the various adjustments to such data for \nratemaking analyses. \nUnderwriting\tExpenses\t\nIn addition to loss adjustment expenses (i.e., claim-related expenses), companies incur other expenses in \nthe acquisition and servicing of policies.  These are generally referred to as underwriting expenses (or \noperational and administrative expenses).  Companies usually classify these expenses into the following \nfour categories:   \n\uf0b7 Commissions and brokerage \n\uf0b7 Other acquisition \n\uf0b7 General \n\uf0b7 Taxes, licenses, and fees \n \nCommissions and brokerage are amounts paid to insurance agents or brokers as compensation for \ngenerating business.  Typically, these amounts are paid as a percentage of premium written.  It is common \nfor commissions to vary between new and renewal business and may be based on the quality of the \nbusiness written or the volume of business written or both. \nOther acquisition costs are expenses other than commissions and brokerage expenses paid to acquire \nbusiness.  This category, for example, includes costs associated with media advertisements and mailings \nto prospective insureds.", "type": "Document"}}
