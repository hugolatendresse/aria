Such \nexpected claims become the input for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique. In the Benktander \ntechnique, the expected claims are the projected ultimate claims from an initial Bornhuetter-\nFerguson projection \u2013 thus, the reference to the Benktander method as an iterative Bornhuetter-\nFerguson method. It is interesting to note that the Benktander projection of ultimate claims will \napproach the projected ultimate claims produced by the development technique after sufficient \niterations. (See Thomas Mack\u2019s 2000 ASTIN paper for the detailed proof.) \n \nIn Exhibits V and VI, we present the Benktander technique using our six examples of changing \nenvironments. We follow the same exhibit format that was presented earlier in this chapter for the \nBornhuetter-Ferguson technique. The only difference between the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \nprojections in Exhibits III and IV and the Benktander projections in Exhibits V and VI are the \nexpected claims. In the Bornhuetter-Ferguson projections, we derive the expected claims based \non the initial expected claim ratio multiplied by the earned premium. In the Benktander \nprojections, the expected claims are based on the Bornhuetter-Ferguson projections (from \nExhibits III and IV). \n \nIn the following table, we summarize the differences from the true unpaid claims, in thousands of \ndollars, based on the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique and the Benktander technique for the six \nexamples related to changing environments. \n160", "type": "Document"}}
