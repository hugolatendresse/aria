A compound limit that includes both \na per claimant and a per occurrence limit is commonly referred to as a split limit.  For example, in \npersonal automobile insurance, a split limit for bodily injury liability of $15,000/$30,000 means that in \nthe event the insured causes an accident, the policy will pay each injured party up to $15,000 with the \ntotal payment to all injured parties not to exceed $30,000.  Another common compound limit is an \noccurrence/aggregate limit; it limits the amount payable for any one occurrence and for all occurrences \nincurred during the policy period.  For example, assume an annual professional liability policy has a limit \nof $1,000,000/$3,000,000.  The policy will not pay more than $1,000,000 for any single occurrence and \nwill not pay more than $3,000,000 for all occurrences incurred during the policy period.  \nThe focus of this section will be on determining indicated increased limit factors (ILFs) for a single limit.  \nCompound and split limits are more complex in that both limits must be considered.   \nStandard\tILF\tApproach\t\nIt is possible to aggregate policies based on the limit purchased and to use univariate (e.g., loss ratio or \npure premium) analysis or multivariate techniques (e.g., GLMs) to calculate indicated rate differentials \nfor the various limits (commonly referred to as \u201cincreased limits factors\u201d).  However, since increased \nlimits offer protection for larger, less common liability claims, the data per limit tends to be very sparse \nand the results can be very volatile.  Consequently, actuaries often use special techniques for increased \nlimits ratemaking.", "type": "Document"}}
