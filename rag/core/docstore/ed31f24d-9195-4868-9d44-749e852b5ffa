Coverage for policies written between January 1, 2015 and \nDecember 31, 2015 would extend over an 18-month period, of which the midpoint would be 9 months \n(i.e., September 30, 2015).  The trend length would be 4.25 years, as displayed below. \n  \nIf the historical data were aggregated by policy year, the average loss occurrence date with respect to an \nannual policy term would be one year after the start of the policy year, as policies are in effect over a 24-\nmonth period.  The \u201ctrend to\u201d date is the average loss occurrence date for the policy year period in which \nrates will be in effect.  Therefore, the trend period for Policy Year 2011 annual term policies is 4 years \n(January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015), as shown in Exhibit 6.17.  The Policy Year 2011 trend factor , \nwhich would be applied to Policy Year 2011 losses, is 1.0406 ( = 1.014.0). \n  \nExhibit 6.18 shows the same policy year scenario but with semi-annual policies.  Both the \u201ctrend from\u201d \nand \u201ctrend to\u201d dates are three months earlier than the annual policy scenario since the average occurrence \ndate for semi-annual policies is nine months after the start of the policy year.
