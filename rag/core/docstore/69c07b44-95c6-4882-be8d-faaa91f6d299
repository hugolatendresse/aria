Since the variables and \ninteractions included in the model are only a subset \nof the universe of predictive variables, there may be \nunexplained signal in the model residuals.  Given \nthat geography is a useful basis for examining \npatterns in the residuals, actuaries often examine the \ngeographic residual variation.  The parameters from each of the various geographic predictors, including a \npredictor variable for the geographic residual variation, can be combined to form one composite risk \nindex or score that represents the geographic signal for each geographic unit.   \nSmoothing\t\nGeographic risk tends to be similar for units that are close in proximity.  Consequently, actuaries may use \nspatial smoothing techniques to improve the estimate of any individual unit by using information from \nnearby units.  There are two basic types of spatial smoothing:  distance-based and adjacency-based.   \nThe distance-based approach smoothes by weighting the information from one geographic unit with the \ninformation from all nearby geographic units based on the distance from the primary unit and some \nmeasure of credibility.  The influence of nearby areas is deemed to diminish with increasing distance.   \nDistance-based smoothing has the advantage of being easy to understand and implement.  A disadvantage \nto this approach is the assumption that a certain distance (e.g., a mile) has the same impact on similarity \nof risk regardless of whether it is an urban or rural area.  Additionally, the presence of a natural or \nartificial boundary (e.g., river or highway) between two geographic units is not taken into consideration \nwhen determining distance.  This assumption tends to be most appropriate for weather-related perils.  \nAdjacency-based smoothing weights the information from one geographic unit with the information", "type": "Document"}}
