Chapter 6 explained that the purpose of the trend factor is to project \nhistorical losses to a future period.  The purpose of the detrend factor is to adjust the current loss \ncosts to a historical experience period.  For example, the average accident date of the prospective \npolicy period is January 1, 2011.  For the policy period beginning July 1, 2008, the length of the \ndetrend period is two years (the length of time between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2009).  \nFor a loss trend of 4.5%, the detrend factor for the 2008 policy period is the reciprocal of the \ntrend plus 1.0, raised to the length of the detrend period [=0.916 = (1/1.045)2]. \n \nThe expected basic limits losses and ALAE unreported at March 31, 2010, (column 8 above) are the \nproduct of the following: \n\uf0b7 The company subject basic limits losses and ALAE \n\uf0b7 The expected experience ratio (EER) \n\uf0b7 The expected percentage basic limits losses and ALAE unreported at March 31, 2010 (note that \nthese are derived from a separate analysis). \n \t\n15.3 Calculation of E xp ected  U nrep orted  Losses and  ALAE  and  Sub ject Loss Costs\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)\nPolicy Period Cov erage\nCurrent \nCompany B/L \nLos s  & ALAE \nCosts\nDetrend \nFactors\nCompany \nSub ject B/L \nLos s  & ALAE \nCosts\nExpe c te d \nExpe r i e nc e  \nRatio\nExpe c te d \nPercentage B/L \nLos s es  & ALAE \nUnr e por te d at \n3/31/10\nExpe c te d B / L", "type": "Document"}}
