In such cases, the actuary should consider combining similar levels to \nincrease the credibility or look for additional relevant data.  \nThe science of classification requires balancing two objectives:  grouping risks into a sufficient number of \nlevels to ensure the risks within each group are homogeneous while being careful not to create too many \ngranularly defined groups that may lead to instability in the estimated costs. \nOperational\tCriteria\t\nEven if a rating variable effectively segments risk, it may not be practical to use in a rating algorithm due \nto operational considerations.  For a rating variable to be considered practical, it should be  \n\uf0b7 Objective \n\uf0b7 Inexpensive to administer \n\uf0b7 Verifiable  \n \nFirst, the levels within a rating variable should have objective definitions.  For example, it seems logical \nthat the estimated costs for medical malpractice insurance vary by the skill level of a surgeon.  However, \nthe skill level of a surgeon is difficult to determine and somewhat subjective; therefore, it is not a \npractical choice for a rating variable.  Instead, companies can use more objective rating variables like \nboard certification, years of experience, and prior medical malpractice claims that serve as proxies for \nskill level.  \nSecond, the operational cost to obtain the information necessary to properly classify and rate a given risk \nshould not be too high.  For example, there are building techniques and features that improve the ability \nof a home to withstand high winds.  If these items significantly reduce expected losses, statistically \nspeaking the company should implement a rating variable to recognize the differences.  Unfortunately, the \nexistence of some of the features cannot be easily identified without a very thorough inspection of the \nhome performed by a trained professional.
