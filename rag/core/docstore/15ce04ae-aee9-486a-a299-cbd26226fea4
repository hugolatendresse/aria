It is more time-consuming to compute, \nbut the calculations are straightforward.  It generates the same criticism as the other methods because it is \nnot based on actual data from the layer being priced. \nFitted\tCurves\t\nAs discussed in the increased limits section in Chapter 11, actual loss distributions can be very volatile, \nespecially in the tail of the distribution (i.e., the higher losses).  As such, any estimates based directly on \nactual data are subject to inaccuracy due to the volatility.  Actuaries may fit curves to the actual data to \nsmooth out the volatility and to extrapolate the distribution to higher limits.  \nOnce the curve is fitted, the techniques described in Chapter 11 can be used to determine the expected \nlosses in the layer being priced.

This approach tends to be significantly more \naccurate than the others when there are relatively few claims in the higher layers.   \nBecause the curve-fitting process involves the underlying data, it can be heavily dependent on the \nexistence or non-existence of larger claims.
