Using these two triangles the actuary can calculate a ratio \nof the paid claims-to-reported claims (also known as the paid-to-reported ratio). Building a \ntriangle using such ratios allows the actuary to analyze the evolution of this relationship over the \nexperience period.  \n \nAs a diagnostic tool, this ratio examines the consistency of paid claims relative to reported \nclaims. It is an important tool for testing whether there might have been changes in case \noutstanding adequacy or in settlement patterns. Since we are analyzing a ratio, we need to \ninvestigate further any changes observed to determine if the change is occurring in paid claims \n(i.e., the numerator) or in the case outstanding, which are a critical component of the reported \nclaims (i.e., the denominator). However, if we do not observe changes in the ratio of paid-to-\nreported claims, it does not necessarily mean that changes are not occurring. There could be \noffsetting changes in both claim settlement practices and the adequacy of case outstanding that \nresult in no change to the ratio of paid-to-reported claims.  \n \nIn our example, claims department management believes that the new claims settlement practices \nresulted in a speed-up in claims closure. Based on this information, we would expect paid claims \nto be increasing along the latest diagonals relative to prior years. Management also reported that \nthe new policies related to case outstanding are resulting in stronger unpaid case than in prior \nyears. Therefore, reported claims should also be increasing along the latest diagonals of the \ntriangle.
