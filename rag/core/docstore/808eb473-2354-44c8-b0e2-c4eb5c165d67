The industry responded by \nchanging the policy feature to cap the replacement cost (e.g., 125% of policy limit). \nIn more recent years, the property insurance industry has implemented other means to encourage \ninsurance to full value.  For example, insurers are using more sophisticated property estimation tools.  \nPreviously these tools were crude estimators that considered a limited number of inputs when calculating \nvalue (e.g., square footage and number of rooms) and updated the value at renewal according to broad \ngeographic indices.  Today\u2019s component indicator tools consider customized features of the home (e.g., \ngranite countertops, hardwood floors, age of plumbing and electricity); moreover, these same tools are \nused to estimate insured value at renewal as well.   \nBy increasing the amount of insurance on underinsured homes to the level of ITV assumed in the rates, \ncompanies are able to generate additional premium without increasing rates.  Since homeowners loss \ndistributions tend to be left-skewed (i.e., small losses predominate), the increased premium is more than \nthe additional losses generated from this action.  As the insureds receive increased coverage, they are \ngenerally more accepting of the increased premium than if rate increases were implemented.  \nIn addition to property estimation tools, the industry has made better use of property inspections, \nindexation clauses, and education of insureds.  As with any major change to insurance company \noperations, the actuaries need to estimate the effect of any ITV initiative on overall results. \nSUMMARY\t\nThe preceding two chapters outlined basic classification ratemaking techniques designed to achieve \nequity among insureds.  This chapter outlined some other methods used by actuaries to determine \nequitable rates based on a few important risk characteristics.", "type": "Document"}}
