We begin Chapter 3 with a description of the \ntypes of data and how data is organized. In Chapter 4, we discuss the importance of meeting with \nthose involved with the operations and processes underlying the data (labeled in this text as \nmanagement) and understanding the environment in which the insurer operates \u2013 both the internal \nand external environments. In Chapter 5, we construct development triangles. We conclude Part 2 \nwith Chapter 6 in which we combine the knowledge we obtain by analyzing the development \ntriangles with the information we receive during meetings with the insurer\u2019s claims and \nunderwriting departments. In this chapter, we use the development triangles as a tool to further \nunderstand how changes in an insurer\u2019s operations and the external environment can influence the \nclaims data. This is the final step before we delve into specific techniques for estimating unpaid \nclaims.  \n \nIt is very important for the actuary to communicate with the insurer\u2019s management if the changes \nthat management reports to have implemented are not supported by the data. It is quite common \nfor an insurer\u2019s management to report significant changes in both the claims settlement area and \nthe strength (i.e., adequacy) of its case outstanding. Insurers may try to accomplish such changes \nthrough new policies, procedures, and/or information systems. Many times actuaries do see \nevidence of operational change in the quantitative data that they are reviewing. However, in some \nsituations, the best intentions of senior claims management may not have worked through the \norganization as planned; in these situations a direct effect on the claims data may not be evident \nto the actuary. Sometimes, it is just a matter of time before signs of the operational changes start", "type": "Document"}}
