Sometimes the actuary fits an exponential or linear trend to the data15 to \nguide the selection; however, as the changes in average written premium are normally pretty consistent \nfrom one time period to the next, curve-fitting is usually not necessary.  The selected trend factor is used \nto adjust the historical premium to the expected levels after consideration of distributional shifts. \nBased on the data in Table 5.24, the actuary may make a trend selection of 2%.  This is the amount the \nactuary expects the average premium to change annually.  The actuary needs to determine the length of \ntime the trend should be applied (i.e., the trend period).  Assuming the ratemaking analysis uses written \npremium as the basis of the trend selection and earned premium for the overall rate level indications \n(which is standard), the trend period is typically measured as the length of time from the average written \ndate of policies with premium earned during the historical period to the average written date for policies \nthat will be in effect during the time the rates will be in effect.  \nConsider the case that the actuary uses Calendar Year 2011 earned premium for the analysis to estimate \nthe rate need for annual policies that are to be written during the period of January 1, 2013 through \nDecember 31, 2013.  Using concepts described earlier, this can be represented with the following figure: \n \nThe Calendar Year 2011 earned premium contains premium from policies that were written almost one \nyear prior to the start of the calendar year (i.e., January 2, 2010) through to policies that were written on \nthe very last day of Calendar Year 2011 (i.e., December 31, 2011).  Thus, the average written date for \npremium earned in Calendar Year 2011 is January 1, 2011.  In the projected period, policies will be", "type": "Document"}}
