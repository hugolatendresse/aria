The actuary would also adjust claims for trend, \nbenefit-level changes, and other similar factors. From a theoretical perspective, these methods \nrequire such adjustment. From a practical perspective, however, such information is often \nunavailable. In these situations, many actuaries continue to use both the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \nand Cape Cod methods for the purpose of developing the unpaid claim estimate without the \nadjustment of premiums or claims. Under such circumstances, it would be prudent for the \nactuary, when evaluating the results of various techniques and selecting final ultimate claims \nvalues, to take into consideration where simplifying assumptions (such as not adjusting premium \nfor rate level changes) were required. \n \n \nXYZ Insurer \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheets 1 through 3, we use the Cape Cod technique for XYZ Insurer.
