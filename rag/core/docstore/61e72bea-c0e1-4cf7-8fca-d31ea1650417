(In Part 3, Chapters 7 through 15, we \nreview numerous examples of changing environments and examine the result of such changes on \nalternative techniques for estimating unpaid claims.) \n \nThe development triangle is one of the actuary\u2019s most important tools for displaying and \nanalyzing data; it is an important component of many claims projection techniques. In Chapter 5, \nwe describe in depth how to create a development triangle. The development triangle is also a \ncritical tool in the evaluation of the influence of operational and environmental changes on \nclaims. In Chapter 6, we present a detailed example of how actuaries can use development \ntriangles as a diagnostic tool, allowing examination of the consequences of operational and \nenvironmental changes on historical claims. \n27", "type": "Document"}}
