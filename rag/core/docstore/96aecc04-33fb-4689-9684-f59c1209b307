Furthermore, actuaries can use frequency-severity methods for projecting \nunpaid claims for both primary layers of coverage and excess layers of insurance. \n \nTechnically, frequency refers to the number of claims per unit of exposure, and severity refers to \nthe average cost per claim. Thus, for a true frequency-severity projection method, the actuary \nwould require historical data for the claims, number of claims, and exposures. In practice, many \nactuaries use the term \u201cfrequency-severity methods\u201d to refer to projections of ultimate claim \ncounts multiplied by ultimate severities without the direct incorporation of an exposure \nmeasurement. \n \n \nTypes of Frequency-Severity Techniques \n \nThere are many different types of projection methods that fall under the classification of \nfrequency-severity techniques. In this chapter, we examine three different types of frequency-\nseverity projection methods. Since the number of claims is not available from our source of the \nconsolidated industry data in the U.S., which is Best\u2019s Aggregates & Averages, we are not able to \ncarry forward most of the examples contained in the preceding chapters. We do, however, \ncontinue with our example for XYZ Insurer.  \n                                                 \n60 CAS Discussion Paper Program, 1988. \n194", "type": "Document"}}
