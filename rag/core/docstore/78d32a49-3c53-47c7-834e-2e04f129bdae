The Benktander \ntechnique is also less responsive to changes in the product mix than the Bornhuetter-Ferguson \ntechnique.  \n \nNote that the Benktander method always gives greater credibility to the development technique. \nThus, where there are no changes in the underlying claim development patterns, we expect the \nBenktander method to be more responsive than the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. Where claim \ndevelopment patterns are changing, the Benktander method may not produce the most appropriate \nestimate as seen in the examples with changing case outstanding adequacy and changes in \nproduct mix.
