ALAE costs are estimated to be \n11% of total losses.   \n\uf0b7 The deductible applies to losses only.  The total ground-up losses without recognition of a \ndeductible are estimated to be $1,000,000.   \n\uf0b7 The fixed expenses are assumed to be $50,000. \n\uf0b7 Variable expenses are assumed to be 13% of premium. \n\uf0b7 The insurer will make the payments on all claims and will seek reimbursement for amounts below \nthe deductible from the insured.  The cost of processing deductibles is estimated to be 4% of the \nlosses below the deductible.   \n\uf0b7 Deductible recoveries will not be fully collateralized, and the associated credit risk is estimated to \nbe 1% of the expected deductible payments. \n\uf0b7 The desired underwriting profit for a full-coverage (i.e., no deductible) premium is 2%.  The \ninsurer includes an additional risk margin of 10% of excess losses for policies with a deductible \nof $500,000.   \n\uf0b7 The percent of total losses below the deductible (i.e., Loss Elimination Ratio or LER) and the \npercent of total losses above the deductible (i.e., excess ratio) are summarized in the table below. \n \n \nThe premium for this policy is developed based on the following formula: \n.Provision)Profit   - Provision   Expense  Variable- (1.0\nMarginRisk   Risk Credit    Expense  Fixed   ALAE  Deductible  above  Losses  Premium \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  \nThe first step in deriving the premium is to estimate losses above the $500,000 deductible.
