One way \nto mitigate this bias is to use variable premium at current rate level and at base level instead of exposures \nfor weights in the approximation.  Recall that variable premium is the premium before addition of any \nfixed expense fees or other additive premium.  The current rate level adjustment for the premium in this \nanalysis should be done at the class level (i.e., applying the parallelogram method to fully aggregated data \nwould not be suitable).  The phrase \u201cat base level\u201d means that the variable premium for non-base levels is \nadjusted to remove the effect of the current rate differential.  For multiplicative factors this means \ndividing the variable premium for each non-base level by the current rate differential for the given \nvariable.  Assuming the rating algorithm is entirely multiplicative and the current rate level adjustment is \nnot too time-consuming, calculating variable premium at base level may be a feasible improvement.  \nWhen the rating algorithm has both multiplicative and additive components, the derivation of variable \npremium at current rate level and at base level becomes so challenging that the effort to improve the \napproximation would be better spent compiling data to undertake the extension of exposures technique.    \nApproximated\tChange\tin\tAverage\tRate\tDifferential\tMethod\t\t\nOne of the issues with this approximated average rate differential method is that the actuary needs to \ncalculate the weighted average proposed rate relativities for each rating variable.  When the variable \npremium portion of the rating algorithm is entirely multiplicative, the actuary may prefer to estimate the \nchange in the average rate differential; by doing so, the actuary can focus solely on the rating variables \nthat are changing. \nRecall that the proposed average premium is the current average premium multiplied by the proposed \noverall change in average premium:", "type": "Document"}}
