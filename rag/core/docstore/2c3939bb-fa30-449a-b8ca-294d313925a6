We no longer live in this kind of environment. Our \nestimation methods should be adapted to fit the current environment and \ngrounded firmly in our understanding of the claims process, even for estimation \nof peripheral liabilities like ULAE. \n \nSimilar observations are expressed by Kay Kellogg Rahardjo in the 1996 paper \u201cA Methodology \nfor Pricing and Reserving for Claim Expenses in Workers Compensation.\u201d94 She states: \n \nIt is no longer acceptable for companies to estimate unallocated loss adjustment \nexpenses (ULAE) and, in particular, claim expense reserves by using paid to paid \nratios. The paid to paid methodology assumes that claims incur expenses only \nwhen initially opened and when closed. While this may not be an unreasonable \nassumption for claims from short-tailed lines, this is definitely not true for \nliability claims. Moreover, the paid to paid ratio itself is subject to distortion \nwhen a company is growing or shrinking or when a line of business is in \n\u201ctransition\u201d, as was the case for workers compensation throughout the early \n1990s as many large customers moved to deductible policies or towards self-\ninsurance. \n \nAs noted previously, there are challenges associated with the use of the classical technique due to", "type": "Document"}}
