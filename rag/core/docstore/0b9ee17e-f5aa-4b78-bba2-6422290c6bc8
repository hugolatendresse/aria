A ratio is calculated for each expense category by \ndividing the relevant historical underwriting expenses by either written or earned premium for each year \nduring the historical experience period.  As before, the choice of premium measure depends on whether \nthe expenses are generally incurred at the onset of the policy or throughout the policy term.  In the \nexample, general expenses are assumed to be incurred throughout the policy period, and thus are divided \nby earned premium.   \nThe expense ratios are calculated for each year as well as the arithmetic average of the three years.  A \nselection is made using the same considerations discussed earlier.  For this example, the general expense \nratios are very stable and the three-year average ratio is selected.  In contrast, if the ratios demonstrated a \ntrend over time, the actuary may select the most recent year\u2019s ratio or some other value. \nThe selected expense ratio is then divided into fixed and variable ratios.  Ideally, the company has \ndetailed expense data so that this division can be made directly, or the company has activity-based cost \nstudies that help split each expense category appropriately.  In the absence of any such data, the actuary \nshould consult with other professionals within the company to arrive at the best possible assumptions for \nallocating the company\u2019s expenses.  The example assumes 75% of the general expenses are fixed, and", "type": "Document"}}
