Similar to the paid claim development technique, the paid Bornhuetter-\nFerguson method is unaffected by changes only in case outstanding strength. \n \nIn Chapter 7, we saw how increases in case outstanding strength led to increases in age-to-age \nfactors and in cumulative claim development factors. The cumulative claim development factors \nare an important input to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. Thus, if the cumulative claim \ndevelopment factors are changing due to increases in case outstanding strength, it will also have \nan effect on the Bornhuetter-Ferguson projection. The expected claims, on the other hand, remain \nunchanged.  \n \nThe estimated IBNR, in this scenario, based on the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is \ngreater than the actual IBNR requirement. However, the overstatement is less for the reported \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method than for the reported claim development method because we did \nnot increase the expected claims. In Chapter 7, we discuss how there are two forces that \ncontribute to the excessive estimate of IBNR in the development technique. First, age-to-age \nfactors increase due to the change in case outstanding adequacy. Second, we then multiply the \nresulting higher cumulative claim development factors by the latest valuation of reported claims, \nwhich contains higher reported values due to the increase in case outstanding strength. There is, \nin essence, a leveraging effect of higher factors and higher claims in the development technique. \nIn the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, the higher cumulative claim development factors result in \n158", "type": "Document"}}
