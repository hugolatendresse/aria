Internal decision-makers will likely want to \nunderstand the expected profitability and how the proposed rates position the company in the competitive \nmarketplace.   \nOn the other hand, if the company is implementing rate changes that will impact existing policies, then \nthe communications to key stakeholders may be more extensive.  Internal management may want to \nunderstand some of the assumptions and selections involved in the overall rate level indication or rate \ndifferential changes, but more importantly, they will want to understand the impact on competitive \nposition, expected volume, and expected profitability.  As discussed in detail in Chapter 13, the actuary \nwill typically prepare competitive comparisons (e.g., percent wins) under the current and final proposed \nrates, as well as policyholder dislocation analysis for company management (in total as well as by key \nsegments).51  This information is useful for the marketing, sales, and customer service functions to \nprepare for any potential repercussions of large policyholder premium impacts or, on the positive side, to \nfocus advertising on customer segments that will be priced more competitively. \n                                                      \n51 Ideally company management will have seen such analysis prior to the rates being considered final.
