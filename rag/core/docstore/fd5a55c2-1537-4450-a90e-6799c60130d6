The experience period usually ranges from two to five policy years, \nending with the last complete year.  A shorter experience period is more responsive to changes, but more \nsubject to large fluctuations, due to its relative loss immaturity and the reduced aggregate exposure of the \nshorter period.  Conversely, a longer experience period is less responsive to changes but less subject to \nlarge fluctuations in the experience. \nSecond, the historical experience may need to be adjusted for extraordinary losses.  Many experience \nrating plans apply per occurrence caps on the losses in order to exclude unusual or catastrophic losses.  \nThis is often referred to as the maximum single limit per occurrence or MSL.  The caps could apply to \nlosses only, or could apply to loss and ALAE.  If the actual losses are subject to a per occurrence cap, \nthen the expected losses need to be on the same basis.  In addition, caps may be applied to the aggregate \nof all losses in the policy period.", "type": "Document"}}
