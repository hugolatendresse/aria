We present this approach in Exhibit I for a \nCanadian portfolio of private passenger automobile collision coverage (Auto Collision Insurer) \nand in Exhibit II for XYZ Insurer. \n \nIn the second frequency-severity approach, we focus on projecting ultimate claims for the most \nrecent two accident years. The development method can often result in substantial development \nfactors to ultimate for the most recent accident years. Highly leveraged factors typically lead to \ngreater uncertainty in actuarial projections of ultimate claims; this, in turn, results in greater \nuncertainty for the estimate of unpaid claims. It is important for actuaries to consider alternative \nprojection techniques in such situations. The expected claims and Bornhuetter-Ferguson \ntechniques are two of the most commonly used methods to supplement claim development \nmethods, particularly for the most recent accident years. Frequency-severity methods are also a \nvaluable alternative for the actuary. \n \nIn the second frequency-severity approach, we compare, by accident year, the projected ultimate \nnumber of claims to an exposure base. The selected frequency rate (i.e., ultimate number of \nclaims per exposure unit) is then used to project the ultimate number of claims for the most recent \ntwo accident years. The severities for the most recent accident years are based on the \ndevelopment technique applied to reported severities after adjustment for inflation. We use this \napproach in Exhibit III for a self-insurer of U.S. workers compensation (WC Self-Insurer) and in \nExhibit IV for XYZ Insurer. \n \nOur third frequency-severity approach is based on a disposal rate analysis. This final approach \nbuilds upon the basic development triangle used with both claims and claim counts. In this", "type": "Document"}}
