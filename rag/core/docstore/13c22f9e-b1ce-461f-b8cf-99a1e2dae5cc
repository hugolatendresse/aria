In practice, we do not expect the unpaid ULAE to respond fully \nto fluctuations in claim amounts. Mango and Allen cite the example of a sudden drop in claim \ncounts or in the value of claims. We would not expect an immediate drop in the overhead \nexpenses or the number of claims management personnel. \n \nIn this section, we briefly describe several approaches that have been developed since the mid-\n1960s.
