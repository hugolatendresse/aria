As such, the pure premium approach relies on exposures rather than premium and \nis most appropriate for pricing new lines of business or situations when the premium at current rate level \nis difficult to calculate. \nThe loss ratio method\u2019s main statistic is the loss ratio and the outcome of the approach is an indicated \nadjustment to the current rates.  This approach relies on premium rather than exposures, and it is most \nappropriate for pricing lines of business for which there are not clearly defined exposures or where the \nindicated rate change is a critically important statistic for the final pricing decision. \nUsing consistent data and assumptions, the two approaches are mathematically equivalent.", "type": "Document"}}
