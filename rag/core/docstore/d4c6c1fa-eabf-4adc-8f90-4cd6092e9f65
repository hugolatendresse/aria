For some insurance products it may be common for claims to be \nre-opened.  If that is the case, it may be advantageous to add the re-opened and re-closed status \ndescriptions. \n\uf0b7 Claim count:  This field identifies the number of claims by coverage associated with the loss \noccurrence.  Alternatively, if each record or a collection of records defines a single claim by \ncoverage, aggregating claim counts can be accomplished without this explicit field.   \n\uf0b7 Paid loss:  This field captures the payments made for each claim record.  If there are multiple \ncoverages, perils or types of loss, the loss payments can be tracked in separate fields or separate \nrecords.  Additionally, if the product is susceptible to catastrophic losses (e.g., hurricanes for \nproperty coverage), then catastrophic payments are tracked separately either through a separate \nrecord or an indicator included on the record. \n\uf0b7 Event identifier:  This field identifies any extraordinary event (e.g., catastrophe) involving this \nparticular claim. \n\uf0b7 Case reserve:  This field includes the case reserve or the change in the case reserve at the time \nthe transaction is recorded.  For example, if a payment of $500 is made at a particular date, and \nthis triggers a simultaneous change in the case reserve, a record is established for this transaction \nand the paid loss and case reserve fields are populated accordingly.  As with paid losses, the case \nreserve is recorded in separate fields or records by coverage, peril or type of loss and by \ncatastrophe or non-catastrophe claim, if applicable.", "type": "Document"}}
