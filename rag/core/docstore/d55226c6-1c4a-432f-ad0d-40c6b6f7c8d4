The filing requirements vary \nconsiderably by jurisdiction and product.  Some regulation requires the regulator\u2019s approval of the new \nrates before the company can use them.  Other regulation merely requires a copy of the manual rates to be \non file with the regulator.  In some extreme cases, the regulator may promulgate the rates to be used by \nthe carriers but allow a specified range of deviation from these rates. \nIn Canada, insurance rate regulation is executed by the individual provinces.  Similar to the U.S., the type \nof regulation varies considerably among the jurisdictions and by insurance product.  For the personal \nautomobile product, some provinces require approval of filed rates and others operate more on open \ncompetition.  A few provinces have a government insurer for compulsory liability coverages, but allow \nopen competition for other coverages.", "type": "Document"}}
