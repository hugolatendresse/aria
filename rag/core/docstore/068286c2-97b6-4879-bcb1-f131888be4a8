In our example, the latest average written premium data is for \nthe fourth quarter of 2011; thus, the average written date is November 15, 2011.  Note this will be the \n\u201cproject from\u201d date for the second step in the process.  Had the current average written premium been \nbased on Calendar Year 2011 as opposed to the fourth quarter of 2011, then the average written date \nwould have been June 30, 2011.   \nWhen the historical average premium is volatile, the actuary may choose to analyze several data points \nand select a current trend rather than use the ratio described above.  For example, assume the selected \ncurrent annual premium trend were 2%.  The trend length is from the average written date of premium \nearned in the experience period (January 1, 2011, in the annual policy example) to the average written \ndate of the latest period in the trend data (November 15, 2011, in the example), or 0.875 years.  The \nCalendar Year 2011 earned premium would be adjusted by a current premium trend factor of 1.0175 (= \n1.020.875). \nIn Step 2, the actuary selects the amount the average premium is expected to change annually from the \ncurrent level (as of November 15, 2011 in this example) to the level in the projected period.  As in the \none-step trending approach, the \u201ctrend to\u201d date in this projection is the average written date during the \nperiod the proposed rates are expected to be in effect (June 30, 2013).  Thus, the projected trend period is \n1.625 years long (November 15, 2011, to June 30, 2013).  Assuming the actuary selects a projected \nannual premium trend of -1% (e.g., he has knowledge of a campaign to increase deductible amounts), the \nprojected trend factor is 0.9838 (= (1.0 - 0.01)1.625).   \nFor convenience, the following picture depicts the two-step trending periods for the annual policy \nexample. \n \nThe total premium trend factor for two-step trending is the product of the current trend factor and the", "type": "Document"}}
