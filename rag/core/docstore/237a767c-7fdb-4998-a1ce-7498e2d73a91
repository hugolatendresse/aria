The aggregate sum of reported losses across all known claims may not equal the ultimate loss \nfor many years.  Reported losses and ultimate losses are different for two reasons.  First, at any point in \ntime, there may be unreported claims.  The amount estimated to ultimately settle these unreported claims \nis referred to as an incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserve.  Second, the accuracy of case reserves on \nreported claims is dependent on the information known at the time the reserve is set; consequently, the \nreported losses on existing claims may change over time.  The incurred but not enough reported \n(IBNER) reserve (IBNER is also known as development on known claims) is the difference between the \namount estimated to ultimately settle these reported claims and the aggregate reported losses at the time \nthe losses are evaluated.  Therefore, estimated ultimate loss is the sum of the reported loss, IBNR reserve \nand IBNER reserve:  \nReserve.
