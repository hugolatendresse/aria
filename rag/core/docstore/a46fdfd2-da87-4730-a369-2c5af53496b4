In \u201cReinsurance\u201d Patrik states: \n \nThe key innovation of the SB (Stanard-Buhlmann) Method is that the ultimate \nexpected loss ratio for all years combined is estimated from the overall reported \nclaims experience, instead of being selected judgmentally, as in the BF \n(Bornhuetter-Ferguson) Method. A problem with the SB Method is that the IBNR \nby year is highly dependent upon the rate level adjusted premium by year. The \nuser must adjust each year\u2019s premium to reflect the rate level cycle on a relative \nbasis. But this is also a problem with the BF Method.58 \n \nIn our step-by step example of the Cape Cod method, we use the cumulative claim development \npatterns presented in Chapter 7. We begin in Exhibit I, Sheet 1, with the development of the \nestimated claim ratio. In our U.S. Industry Auto example, we do not have details of historical rate \nlevel changes. Thus, in both the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method and the Cape Cod method, we rely \non unadjusted earned premium data.  \n \nIn Column (2) of Exhibit I, Sheet 1, we summarize the unadjusted earned premiums by year. \nColumn (3) contains the age of each accident year as of the latest valuation date, December 31, \n2007. The reported claims in Column (4) are the latest diagonal in the reported claim \ndevelopment triangle presented in Chapter 7. We also derive the claim development factor to \nultimate, Column (5), in Chapter 7. In Column (6), we show the reporting pattern. The percentage \nreported is equal to the inverse of the cumulative reported claim development factor.  \n \nA new concept of the Cape Cod method is the \u201cused-up premium.\u201d The used-up premium is the \ndenominator in our determination of the expected claim ratio. This allocation of premium \nrepresents the premium corresponding to the claims that are expected to be reported through the", "type": "Document"}}
