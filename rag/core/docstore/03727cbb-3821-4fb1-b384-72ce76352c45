If the data is available, \nthe actuary should analyze development out to the point at which the development ceases (i.e., \nuntil the selected development factors are equal to 1.000).  The number of development periods \nrequired generally varies by line, jurisdiction, and data type. \n \nSometimes the data does not provide for enough development periods. This occurs when the \ndevelopment factors for the most mature development periods available are still significantly \ngreater than 1.000.41 When this occurs, the actuary will need to determine a tail factor to bring the \nclaims from the latest observable development period to an ultimate value.   \n \nFor some lines of insurance and some types of claims data, the tail factor can be especially \ndifficult to select due to the limited availability of relevant data. The point of development \nbeyond which no tail factor is required varies tremendously by line of business. For short-tail \ncoverages, insurers generally settle claims within months or a few years of the accident date. \nHowever, for long-tail lines of business, such as U.S. medical professional liability and workers \ncompensation, some claims can take more than fifteen years to reach final settlement.  \n                                                 \n41 There are some cases in which the development at the end of the triangle is often less than one, such as \nfor a line of business with significant subrogation activity after claims are paid. For these lines of business, \nthe desire is still to have sufficient periods in the development triangle so that non-zero development \nceases, but in this case the development factors may approach 1.000 from below. \n89", "type": "Document"}}
