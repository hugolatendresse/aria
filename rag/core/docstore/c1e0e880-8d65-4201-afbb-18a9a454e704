Premium  Average\nPremium  Pure  Premium\nLosses Ratio Loss \uf03d\uf03d  \nFor example, if the total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the total premium is $400,000,000, then the \nloss ratio is 75% (= $300,000,000 / $400,000,000).  Typically, the ratio uses total reported losses and total \nearned premium; however, other variations are common.  For example, companies may include LAE in \nthe calculation of loss ratios (commonly referred to as loss and LAE ratios).  Once again, it is important to \nclarify the inputs being used.  \nHistorically, most companies monitor and analyze the loss and LAE ratio as a primary measure of the \nadequacy of the rates overall and for various key segments of the portfolio.   \nLoss\tAdjustment\tExpense\tRatio\t\nThe loss adjustment expense (LAE) ratio compares the amount of claim-related expense to total losses \nand is calculated as follows: \n . Losses\nExpenses  Adjustment  Loss  Ratio LAE \uf03d   \nThe loss adjustment expenses include both allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses.  \nCompanies may differ as to whether paid or reported (incurred) figures are used.  It is important to \nrecognize that the LAE are being divided by total losses and not by premium, so the loss and LAE ratio is \nnot the sum of the loss ratio and the LAE ratio, but rather is the loss ratio multiplied by the sum of one \nplus the LAE ratio. \nCompanies monitor this ratio over time to determine if costs associated with claim settlement procedures \nare stable or not.  A company may compare its ratio to those of other companies as a benchmark for its \nclaims settlement procedures. \nUnderwriting\tExpense\tRatio\t\nThe underwriting (UW) expense ratio is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay for \nunderwriting expenses, and it is calculated as follows: \n .
