In the paper \u201cEvaluating Bodily Injury Liabilities Using a Claims Closure Model,\u201d \nMartin Adler and Charles D. Kline discuss the rhythm in the claims settlement process: \n \nClaims emerge at an identifiable rate, they are settled at an identifiable rate, the \npayments grow at an identifiable rate and the accuracy of individual case \nestimates improves at an identifiable rate.60 \n \nWhen actuaries use frequency-severity techniques in their simplest form, they project ultimate \nclaims by multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims (i.e., frequency) by the estimated \nultimate average value (i.e., severity). By analyzing claims experience by its frequency and \nseverity components, actuaries are able to examine trends and patterns in the rates of claims \nemergence (i.e., reporting) and settlement (i.e., closure) as well as in the average values of claims. \nThis can be particularly valuable when an organization is undergoing change in operations, \nphilosophy, or management. Frequency-severity methods can also be important to validate or \nreject the findings from other actuarial projection techniques. \n \n \nCommon Uses of Frequency-Severity Techniques \n \nActuaries can use frequency-severity techniques for projecting unpaid claim estimates in a wide \nvariety of situations. They can use them with accident year, policy year, report year, and calendar \nyear data. Generally reinsurers do not use frequency-severity methods with underwriting year \ndata simply because they do not have access to detailed statistics regarding the number of claims. \nFrequency-severity techniques are appropriate for all lines of insurance but are more often used", "type": "Document"}}
