In this case, the projected dollar change is calculated by multiplying the selected annual trend \nby the length of the trend period.  For example, assume the selected annual pure premium linear trend is \n$1.00 per year, then the dollar increase due to 4 years of trend is $4.00 (= $1.00 x 4.0).   \nIn some circumstances, the actuary may choose to undertake a two-step trending process.  This technique \nis beneficial when the actuary believes that the loss trend in the historical experience period and the \nexpected trend for the forecast period are not identical.  For example, some lines of business may require \nseveral historical years be used when projecting losses for ratemaking purposes.  If the trend during that \nhistorical period has been significantly different from what is expected to occur in the future, it may make \nsense to adjust the historical data to current levels accordingly, but to apply a different trend into the \nforecast period to reflect what is expected to occur in the future.  Legislative changes in the trend data are \na particular example when the two-step trending process may be appropriate if the trend exhibited in the \nhistorical period is clearly different from that expected in the future. \nIn the exponential trend data shown in Table 6.14, one can see that the historical severity trend exhibits a \ndifferent pattern in more recent periods than in earlier years.  First, the losses in the experience period are \ntrended from the average accident date in the experience period to the average accident date of the last \ndata point in the trend data.  For example, the average loss occurrence date of Calendar-Accident Year \n2011 (the \u201ctrend from\u201d date) is assumed to be July 1, 2011.  If the last data point in the loss trend data is \nthe twelve months ending fourth quarter 2013, the average accident date of that period (the \u201ctrend to\u201d", "type": "Document"}}
