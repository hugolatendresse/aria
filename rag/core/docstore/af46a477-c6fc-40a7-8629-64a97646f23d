In more stable, short-tailed lines of business (e.g., automobile physical damage), the \nactuary typically analyzes calendar year paid losses for the 12 months ending each quarter.  Calendar year \ndata is readily available, the paid loss definition eliminates any distortion from changes in case reserving \npractices, and the use of 12-month rolling data attempts to smooth out the effect of seasonality.  An \nactuary working on a more volatile and often long-tailed line of business (e.g., workers compensation \nmedical) typically analyzes the trend in accident year reported losses that have already been developed to \nultimate and adjusted for benefit changes.   \nSimilar to loss development, it is prudent to undertake the trend analysis on a body of homogeneous \nclaims; this may imply a line of business or something more granular (e.g., separating indemnity and \nmedical losses within workers compensation insurance).  Liability claims and property claims are \ntypically analyzed separately.  Experience by geography (e.g., state) may also be analyzed separately. \nRegardless of loss definition used, frequency, severity, and pure premium are calculated for each time \nperiod and the change from period to period is analyzed.  Linear and exponential regression models are \nthe most common methods used to measure the trend in the data.  The linear model results in a projection \nthat increases by a constant amount for each unit change in the ratio measured (e.g., claim severities).  \nThe exponential model produces a constant rate of change in the ratio being measured.  Both types of \nmodels may be appropriate when measuring increasing trends, though the linear model will eventually \nproject negative values when measuring decreasing trends.  Since there is no such thing as a negative \nfrequency or severity in insurance, this is a shortcoming of linear trend models.", "type": "Document"}}
