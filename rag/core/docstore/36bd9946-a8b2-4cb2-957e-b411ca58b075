This chapter discusses \npotential actions a company can take if its current rates do not produce an average premium that is \nequivalent to the sum of the expected costs and target underwriting profit.  In particular, this chapter \ndiscusses: \n\uf0b7 Non-pricing solutions to an imbalanced fundamental insurance equation \n\uf0b7 Rate change solutions, including detailed discussion of how to calculate final rates for existing \nproducts and products being introduced \n\uf0b7 Communicating the expected effect of rate changes to key stakeholders (e.g., regulators and \ncompany management) and monitoring results after implementation. \nEXAMPLE\tIMBALANCE\t\t\nThis chapter uses the notation introduced in the Foreword to this text, and considers the same pricing \nexample and assumptions presented in prior chapters (referred to as the \u201csimple example\u201d): \n\uf0b7 The average expected loss and LAE ( L  EL \uf02b ) for each exposure is $180. \n\uf0b7 Each time the company writes an exposure, the company incurs $20 in fixed expenses ( FE ). \n\uf0b7 15% of each dollar of premium collected covers expenses (V) that vary with the amount of \npremium, such as premium taxes. \n\uf0b7 Company management has determined that the target profit provision ( TQ ) is 5% of premium. \nBased on the expected losses, expenses, and target underwriting  profit in the future policy period, the \nindicated average premium per exposure is $250 (= ($180 + $20) / (1.0 \u2013 15% \u2013 5%)).   \nIf the projected average premium assuming the company\u2019s current rates is $235, then the fundamental \ninsurance equation is not in balance.
