Intuitively, the expected loss for one home insured for \ntwo years is two times the expected loss of the same home insured for one year.  The expected loss for \nhomes does vary by a significant number of other characteristics, including the amount of insurance \npurchased.  While the expected loss for a $200,000 home is higher than that for a $100,000 home, it may \nnot necessarily be two times higher.  So based on the criterion that the exposure base should be the factor \nmost directly proportional to the expected loss, number of house years is the preferred exposure base, and \namount of insurance should be used as a rating variable.7 \nIf an exposure base is proportional to the expected loss, then the exposure base should be responsive to \nany change in exposure to risk.  Another example can more clearly demonstrate how the exposure base \nfor some insurance products can be responsive to even small changes in exposure.  Payroll is the \n                                                      \n7 In the U.K. and other countries, some homeowners insurers use amount of insurance or number of bedrooms as an \nexposure base and adjust the rating algorithm to account for the fact that these variables are not directly proportional \nto expected loss.", "type": "Document"}}
