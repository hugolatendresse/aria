For example, most people understand that the presence of a sump \npump in a house has a direct effect on water damage losses to the house (both in propensity to have a \nclaim and the severity of the claim).  As such, a corresponding reduction in premium for the presence of a \nsump pump is likely to be socially acceptable.  In recent years, personal lines insurers have introduced \ninsurance credit scores, a measure of the insured\u2019s financial responsibility, into rating algorithms.  Despite \nthe strong statistical power in predicting losses, the use of this variable has resulted in a consumer \nbacklash stemming from a belief that there is a lack of obvious causality to losses.   \nThird, it is preferable if an insured has some ability to control the class to which they belong and, \nconsequently, be able to affect the premium charged.29  For example, the type and quality of a company\u2019s \nloss control programs can have a significant effect on workers compensation expected losses.  This is a \ncontrollable rating variable as insured companies can implement approved loss control programs in an \n                                                      \n29 This may seem to contradict the comment made in the operational criteria section that it is undesirable to have a \nrating variable that can be manipulated by the insured.  The operational criterion refers to insureds or others \nsupplying false information to earn a cheaper rate.  The controllability criterion refers to the case where an insured \ncan be motivated to improve his risk characteristic and consequently reduce his rate.  The latter often has broader \nsocietal benefits (e.g., insureds purchasing cars with safety devices that afford insurance discounts).", "type": "Document"}}
