If the actuary caps the proposed relativity for any one territory, this \nwill reduce the proposed average rate differential across all territories, which will necessitate an offsetting \nincrease in the proposed base rate in order to achieve the target average premium.  The extent of the \nincrease will depend on the magnitude of the capping and the number of insureds affected by the cap.  \nThe following example outlines a rate change scenario in which the insurer is targeting an overall rate \nlevel change of 15.0%.  As part of the rate change, the insurer is revising relativities for a particular rating \nvariable, and management requires that the premium increase for any level of this variable not exceed \n20%.   \nTable 14.10 shows the current and selected relativities (prior to capping) in Columns (3) and (4).  These \nrelativity changes would result in an off-balance factor of 0.9749 (= 1 / (1 + 2.57%)).  (For simplicity, the \nexample assumes that there is no additive premium.)  The total change to each level is the product of the \nrelativity change factor, the off-balance factor, and the target overall change factor, as displayed in \nColumn (8). \n  \nThe total change for Level 1 is 26.13%, which exceeds the desired maximum change of 20.0%.  The new \ncapped relativity for Level 1 (refer to this as X) is determined such that the product of the relativity \nchange factor (new capped relativity for Level 1 / current relativity for Level 1 = X / 0.8000), the off-\nbalance factor (0.9749), and the overall change factor (1.1500) results in a 20% total change.  The new \ncapped relativity for Level 1 (X) that satisfies this equation is 0.8563. \nIf the total change for Level 1 were limited to 20.0%, the premium achieved would be $165,600 \n(=$138,000 x 1.20).  This presents a shortfall of $8,459 (=$174,059 - $165,600) which will need to be \nmade up by charging the other levels (Levels 2 and 3) higher premium.
