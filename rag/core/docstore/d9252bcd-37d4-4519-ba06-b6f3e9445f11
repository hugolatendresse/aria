We also calculate the estimated IBNR and the \nestimate of total unpaid claims for accident years 2007 and 2008.  \n \nIt is interesting to compare the projection of ultimate claim counts, severities, and claims using \nthis frequency-severity approach and the first approach. The following table summarizes these \nvalues. Ultimate claims from the second approach are roughly half of the projections from the \nfirst approach due to lower projections of both ultimate claim counts and average values per \nclaim. \n \n A p p r o a c h  #  1  A p p r o a c h  #  2  \n2007 Ultimate Claim Counts   \n  Closed Counts Projection 1,804  \n  Reported Counts Projection 1,308  \n  Selected Value 1,556 1,199 \n2007 Severity 37,606 25,448 \n     \n2008 Ultimate Claim Counts   \n  Closed Counts Projection 1,679  \n  Reported Counts Projection 1,172  \n  Selected Value 1,426 1,128 \n2008 Severity 41,544 26,720 \n   \nProjected Ultimate Claims ($000)   \n  Accident Year 2007 58,516 30,512 \n  Accident Year 2008 59,242 30,140 \n \nIn Chapter 15, we compare and contrast the various projection methods for this example. \n \n \nFrequency-Severity Approach #3 \u2013 Disposal Rate Technique  \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nSimilar to the previous two frequency-severity approaches, we begin this final method by \nprojecting reported and closed claim counts to an ultimate value using the development \ntechnique. Thus, we assume that historical patterns of claims emergence and settlement are \npredictive of future patterns of reported and closed claim counts. An implicit assumption of this \nmethod is that there are no significant partial (i.e., interim) payments. \n \nIn this method, we also explicitly incorporate an inflation adjustment for severity.
