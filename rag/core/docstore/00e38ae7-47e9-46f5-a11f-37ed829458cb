For example, the distributional analysis may uncover that \nwhile 15% of homes in a market are valued under $200,000, only 5% of the homes in the company\u2019s \nportfolio have an amount of insurance in that range.  Assuming the company wants to insure those homes, \nthis may be an indication that the rates for homes in this range are uncompetitive.  It could also indicate \nother issues such as poor marketing or inadequate agent placement.  A comparison of distributions over \ntime can reveal whether this low penetration has been consistent or if it is a recent development.  If it is a \nrecent development, it could also indicate that a major competitor recently began targeting homes valued \nless than $200,000 (via marketing strategy, price strategy, etc). \nPolicyholder\tDislocation\tAnalysis\t\nExisting customers are directly impacted when rates are changed; consequently, the amount of any rate \nchange can be a major influence on whether or not an existing insured decides to renew the policy.  The \npurpose of dislocation analysis is to quantify the number of existing customers that will receive specific \namounts of rate change.  The company often uses this information to extrapolate how the rate change may \naffect retention.  In the absence of sophisticated retention modeling techniques (discussed briefly in the \nnext section), companies typically have a threshold defining the magnitude and dispersion of rate changes \nthat the company believes will produce an unacceptable effect on retention (in total or by customer \nsegment).  If the dislocation analysis highlights the effects are outside the tolerance level, the company \nmay revise the proposed rate change.  In addition, knowledge of the expected dislocation can be shared \nwith the sales channel and customer support units (e.g., call centers) in advance of the implementation to", "type": "Document"}}
