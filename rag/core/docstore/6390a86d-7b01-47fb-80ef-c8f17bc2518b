The money received in this transaction is called \u201csalvage\u201d and is treated as a \nnegative loss.   \nAnother way development can be negative is through subrogation.  Insurance companies sometimes pay \nlosses for which another party is actually liable.  After the losses are paid, the company can then approach \nthe responsible party for indemnification of those amounts.  When subrogation or salvage are common, \nage-to-age development factors can be less than 1.00.  Development factors for reported losses can also \nbe less than 1.00 when early case reserves are set too high. \nThis particular example assumes losses are ultimate at 75 months.  For some lines of business, the \nhistorical data triangle may not reach ultimate.  In that case, actuaries may fit curves to historical \ndevelopment factors to extrapolate the development beyond the patterns in the historical data or perform \nspecial studies that include more years of data.  The factor that accounts for any additional development \nbeyond that included in the standard chain ladder method is referred to as a \u201ctail factor.\u201d \nIt is important that loss development patterns are reviewed carefully by the ratemaking actuary.  The \nactuary should have knowledge of the line of business being analyzed, particularly the history of the \nclaims handling procedures and any known events that could create an anomaly in the pattern.   \nThe next step is to calculate age-to-ultimate development factors for each maturity.  The age-to-ultimate \ndevelopment factor is the product of each selected age-to-age development factor and the selected age-to-\nage development factors for subsequent maturities (and the tail factor, if relevant).  For example, the age-\nto-ultimate development factor for losses at age 51 months is the product of the selected age-to-age \ndevelopment factors for 51-63 months and 63-75 months (1.02 x 1.00).", "type": "Document"}}
