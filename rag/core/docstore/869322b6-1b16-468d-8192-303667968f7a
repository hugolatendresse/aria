The choice of written or earned premium will \nhave relatively little impact if a company\u2019s volume of business is not changing materially (since written \npremium will be approximately equal to earned premium).  However, if a company is growing (or \nshrinking) significantly, written premium will be proportionately higher (or lower) than earned premium.  \nSimilarly, during a period of growth (or decline) the acquisition costs will be higher (or lower) than \nduring a period of stable volume.  Use of an appropriate premium measure provides a better match to the \ntypes of expenses incurred during the historical period.   \nEach year U.S. insurance companies must produce an Annual Statement and Insurance Expense Exhibit \n(IEE).  These documents contain a significant amount of accounting data, including historical expense \nand premium data.  However, this data may not be available in the finest level of detail necessary for \nratemaking purposes.  For example, the homeowners data includes renters and mobile homes data, and as \na result, may not be appropriate for deriving expense provisions specifically for homeowners policies.  \nIdeally, the actuary will have access to the source expense data at the level of detail required for each \nproduct or subline priced.  Of course, the actuary should always weigh the cost of obtaining such data \nagainst the additional accuracy gained.   \nTypically, the choice to use countrywide or state data varies by type of expense.  Other acquisition costs \nand general expenses are usually assumed to be uniform across all locations, so countrywide figures \nfound in the IEE are used to calculate these ratios.  The data used to derive commissions and brokerage \nexpense ratios varies from carrier to carrier.  Some carriers use state-specific data and some use \ncountrywide figures, depending on whether the company\u2019s commission plans vary by location.  Taxes,", "type": "Document"}}
