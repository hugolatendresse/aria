The first two \nrows of data only contain losses that are less than $250, which will be completely eliminated by the \ndeductible.  The remaining rows contain individual losses that are at least $250; therefore, $250 will be \neliminated for each of the 5,575 claims (or $1,393,750 in total).  The LER is calculated as losses \neliminated divided by the total losses: \n..,,$\n),,,($),$,($ 1350\n39060413\n543284511871250588207365240 LER($250) \uf03d\uf02b\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  \nThus without any further adjustments, the rate credit for going from full coverage to a $250 deductible is \n13.5%; alternatively, this can be restated as a deductible relativity by subtracting 0.135 from 1.0 (i.e., \n0.865).   \nThe following table shows the calculations discussed above: \n\t\nOther\tConsiderations\t\nThe aforementioned calculations were possible because the ground-up losses were known.  The company \nmay not know the ground-up losses for every claim.  For example, insureds may not report claims that are \nobviously less than the deductible on their policy.  In this case, the database may only include censored \nlosses (i.e., the portion of reported losses that exceed the deductible); these losses are commonly referred \nto as net losses.  When this is the case, data from policies with deductibles greater than the deductible \nbeing priced cannot be used to calculate the loss elimination ratio.  For example, data from policies with a \n$500 deductible cannot be used to determine loss elimination ratios for a $250 or $100 deductible.  \nHowever, data from policies with deductibles less than the deductible being priced can be used to \ndetermine loss elimination ratios (e.g., data from policies with a $500 deductible can be used to determine \nthe loss elimination ratio associated with moving from a $750 deductible to a $1,000 deductible).
