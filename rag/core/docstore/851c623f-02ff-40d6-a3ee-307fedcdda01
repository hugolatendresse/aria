However, if the business mix changes over the experience \nperiod, the results of the development technique may no longer be appropriate for the \ndetermination of the unpaid claim estimate.51 \n \n \nKey Assumptions \n \nFor the changing product mix example, we review a steady-state environment that has no change \nin product mix (called U.S. Auto Steady-State) and an environment with a changing product mix \n(called U.S. Auto Changing Product Mix). \n \nWe continue to use a ten-year experience period, accident years 1999 through 2008, for these two \nfinal examples. We assume that each of the private passenger and commercial automobile \nportfolios had $1 million in earned premiums for 1999. For U.S. Auto Steady-State, we assume \nthat the earned premium for both private passenger and commercial automobile is increasing at an \nannual rate of 5%. For U.S. Auto Changing Product Mix, we assume that the portfolio includes \nthe same private passenger premiums as the steady-state, but commercial automobile insurance \npremiums increase at 30% instead of 5% per year starting in 2005.  \n                                                 \n51 We construct this example for demonstration purposes only. Information regarding product mix is \ngenerally available so that the actuary would be able to make modifications to the methodology and/or the \nkey assumptions for the purpose of estimating unpaid claims. Nevertheless, it is important to observe how a \nchange in product mix can affect the results of the various methodologies for estimating unpaid claims \npresented in this and the following chapters. \n103", "type": "Document"}}
