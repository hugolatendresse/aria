If the historic data had an even \nspread of claims across the months, but the most recent accident year had an uneven spread due to \na large storm or other event in the last month or due to an increase in the exposures over the year, \nthe historical data will have an average occurrence date that is not comparable to the most recent \naccident year.     \n \nFor long-tail lines of insurance, such as U.S. workers compensation and general liability, the \ncumulative claim development factors can become very large for the most recent accident years, \nparticularly when using the paid claim development technique. Actuaries often speak of the \nleveraged effect of claim development factors with high values. For example, if the cumulative \nreported claim development factor is 4.00, each dollar of reported claims is multiplied by a factor \nof 4.00 to determine ultimate claims. It is not unusual for long-tail lines of insurance to have \ncumulative paid claim development factors greater than 10.00. These highly leveraged factors \nresult in projections of ultimate claims that are very sensitive to the current value of paid and \nreported claims. The presence or absence of large claims as well as any unusual change in the \nreporting or settlement of claims (or sometimes just a single claim) can result in unreasonable \nprojections of ultimate claims for the most recent accident years. In situations of highly leveraged \ncumulative claim development factors, actuaries often seek alternative techniques for estimating \nunpaid claims. \n \n \nXYZ Insurer \n \nIn Exhibit II, Sheets 1 through 4, we continue the example introduced in Chapter 6 for XYZ \nInsurer. This example is for an insurer of private passenger automobile bodily injury liability in a \nsingle jurisdiction that has experienced numerous operational and environmental changes.
