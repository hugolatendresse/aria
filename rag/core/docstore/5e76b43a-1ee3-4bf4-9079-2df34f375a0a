Berquist and Sherman begin their paper with the following: \n \nWhile specific guidelines for reserve adequacy testing may be established and \nspecific examples of an actuarial approach to the testing of loss reserves may be \noffered for particular situations, loss reserving cannot be reduced to a purely \nmechanical process or to a \u201ccookbook\u201d of rules and methods. The utilization and \ninterpretation of insurance statistics requires an intimate knowledge of the \ninsurance business as well as the actuary\u2019s ability to quantify complex \nphenomena which are not readily measurable. As in the case of ratemaking, \nwhile certain general methods are widely accepted, actuarial judgment is required \nat many critical junctures to assure that reserve projections are neither distorted \nnor biased. \n \nBerquist and Sherman identify the following specific areas where actuarial judgment is required: \n \n\uf0be Determining the optimal combination of the kinds of claims data to be used in the estimation \nof unpaid claims \n \n\uf0be Assessing the effect of changes in an insurer\u2019s operations on the claims data that is used in \nestimating unpaid claims \n \n\uf0be Adjusting the claims data for the influences of known and quantifiable events \n \n\uf0be Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various estimation techniques \n \n\uf0be Making the final selection of the unpaid claim estimate \n \nPart 3 \u2013 Basic Techniques for Estimating Unpaid Claims addresses all of these areas. Through the \nuse of numerous examples, which span multiple chapters, we examine different combinations of \ndata and use them with a wide range of actuarial projection methods.
