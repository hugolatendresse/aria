# RAG Tool Test

This is a test file to verify that the RAG tool has been successfully integrated into Cline.

## What was implemented:

1. Added `rag_search` to the `toolUseNames` array in `src/core/assistant-message/index.ts`
2. Added RAG-specific parameters (`query`, `knowledge_base`, `max_results`) to `toolParamNames` array
3. Added `ragSearch` tool type to the `ClineSayTool` interface in `src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts`
4. Implemented the RAG tool case in `ToolExecutor.ts` with proper handling of:
   - Partial messages
   - Parameter validation
   - Auto-approval logic
   - Error handling
   - Tool result formatting
5. Added `performRagSearch` method with placeholder implementation
6. Updated system prompts (both generic and next-gen) to include RAG tool definition
7. Updated capability lists to mention RAG functionality

## Testing:

You can now test the RAG functionality by asking Cline to search for information using queries like:
- "Use RAG to search for information about React hooks"
- "Search the knowledge base for authentication patterns"
- "Find documentation about error handling in Node.js"

The current implementation is a placeholder that returns sample results. To make it functional, you'll need to:

1. Replace the `performRagSearch` method with actual RAG service integration
2. Set up your knowledge base (vector database, embeddings, etc.)
3. Implement the actual search logic

## Next Steps:

Consider implementing one of these approaches:
- **Vector Database Integration**: Connect to Pinecone, Chroma, or Weaviate
- **Local RAG**: Use libraries like LangChain with local embeddings
- **API Integration**: Connect to existing RAG services or APIs
- **MCP Server**: Create a dedicated MCP server for RAG functionality
